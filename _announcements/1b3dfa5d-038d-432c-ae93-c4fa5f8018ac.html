<p>Feedback Hub App: 1.1609.2801.0 for PC and Mobile</p>

<p>Applicable Ring: <strong>Fast</strong> Ring Store update</p>

<p><strong>You can now read and comment on both mobile and PC feedback, whether you're using your PC or mobile device</strong></p>

<p>We are happy to announce that now you can reach and comment on both mobile and PC feedback, whether you're using a PC or mobile device.</p>

<p>We introduced the new feature to let users:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Search and browse feedback from all form factors regardless of your current device form factor. For example, you can now see Mobile from Desktop </li>

  <li>Open feedback from any form factor via URI or links </li>

  <li>Comment on any feedback item regardless of form factor </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>You can now easily switch between your Microsoft accounts while in Feedback Hub</strong></p>

<p>You can now easily switch accounts in Feedback Hub and sign in with different MSAs. This helps with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Being able to easily see Insider or Retail views </li>

  <li>Use a registered MSA to sign in if it is different than the MSA used to sign in to OS </li>
</ul>
