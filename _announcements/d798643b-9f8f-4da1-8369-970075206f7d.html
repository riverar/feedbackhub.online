<p>Thank you for helping us build Windows 10! The Insider program has been a great success with more than 5 million registered Insiders from around the world. As an Insider, you have truly co-created Windows 10 with us.</p>

<p>With Windows 10 shipping soon, we’ve decided to include the Feedback app in the final version of the product – the 10<sup>th</sup> most popular Insider suggestion with close to 8,000 upvotes! At the same time, we wanted to continue giving you, our Insiders, an exclusive and premier experience. With that in mind, here’s what you can expect from the Feedback app going forward:</p>

<p>· All users will have Search, New Feedback, Upvote Feedback and SIUF Questions</p>

<p>· Only Insiders will see Insider Feedback, have the ability to add a screen shot, reproduce a problem, and filter feedback by build.</p>

<p><i>*Only available in select categories</i></p>

<p>We’re also taking this opportunity to clear out the older feedback that we received earlier on in our product development cycle so it will no longer display in search result.&nbsp;Don’t worry, your feedback will still be in our backend system and will continue to be used by our engineering teams to make improvements—you’ll still get credit for your contributions in Insider Hub, too.&nbsp; You can always view a full history of <i>your</i> feedback under <b>My feedback</b> with a special <b>Archive</b> demarcation for pre-release feedback.</p>
