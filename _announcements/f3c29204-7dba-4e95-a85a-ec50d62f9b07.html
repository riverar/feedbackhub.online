<p><b>UPDATE 5/25:</b> We are releasing Build 14342.1004 today for Windows Insiders in the Fast ring. This build is exactly the same but with some additional fixes including a fix for the battery life issues we were seeing on some devices such as the Lumia 930, 929 and others which was also causing these devices to get hot. </p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>Today we are releasing Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview Build 14342 to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring.</p>

<p><del>Please note that due to a bug, this update will show up as 10.0.0.1001 instead of 10.0.14342.1001 under Phone update in the Settings app</del>. We fixed this bug and doesn’t appear to be an issue for Insiders.</p>

<p>We are excited to announce that we have added 3 new devices to the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-supported-phones">list of devices capable of receiving updates from our Development Branch</a> as part of the Windows Insider Program: Lumia Icon, BLU Win HD LTE 150e, and BLU Win JR 130e.</p>

<h3><strong>Here’s what’s new in Build 14342</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Swipe navigation in Microsoft Edge:</strong> Since the release of Windows 10 Mobile, our top feedback request for Microsoft Edge has been asking for the return of the swipe gesture to navigate back and forward. With this build, you can now swipe from anywhere on the page to get back to your previous page.</p>

<p><strong>Apps for websites:</strong> As <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B831">we discussed at Build 2016</a>, you will soon be able to redirect certain websites to open with an app instead. This is a new capability so apps that support this are still in progress. In preparation for their availability we have added a new page at Settings &gt; System &gt; Apps for websites where you will be able to manage them. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

<p><strong>Feedback Hub improvements:</strong> We’ve heard from you that it can sometimes be hard to find which category your feedback belongs in. Now when you create new feedback, the Feedback Hub will suggest categories and subcategories based on the title and description you entered. If you see a suggestion that looks right, just click it to fill in the menus and get your feedback to the right engineers quickly.</p>

<h3><strong>Here’s what’s fixed for Mobile</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>We fixed an issue causing installation of mobile builds to fail with Error 80070002. </li>

  <li>Language and Speech Packs should download without any errors. </li>

  <li>We have fixed the issue causing DRM-protected content from services like Groove Music, Microsoft Movies &amp; TV, Netflix, Amazon Instant Video or Hulu to fail on playback with 0x8004C029 or 0x8004C503 errors. </li>

  <li>We fixed the issue where some users with some non-English keyboards were not able to enter letters such as w, y, and a when typing into the address bar of the Edge browser. </li>

  <li>We fixed the issue causing your phone to lock up and reboot when it receives a notification from an app that has “Keep notifications private on the lock screen” turned on under Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications &amp; actions. </li>

  <li>We increased font size and improved spacing of the data migration page after receiving an update. </li>

  <li>Polished icons used to identify pages in the Settings app – in particular, updated battery icon to be more consistent with the weight of the other icons. </li>

  <li>Improved performance when retrieving updated GPS coordinates while driving. </li>

  <li>Goodbye message on shutdown will now remain visible until the last moment, to make it easier to determine when your device is off. </li>

  <li>Polished the look of media controls on the Lock screen. When you press one of the media control buttons, it appears “pressed”. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where some apps, including Tweetium, would crash on launch. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where Action Center’s context menus would appear in the wrong orientation if the app underneath was in landscape mode. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where Lumia 435, 532, 535 and 540 would fail to record video, as well as an issue where advanced camera settings were not preserved when taking a photo with the Lumia 435, resulting in the photo being taken with default settings instead. </li>

  <li>Fixed an issue where the same device might be listed multiple times under Connect. </li>

  <li>Fixed an issue where quickly pressing the power button twice when Windows Hello is enabled could result in the display appearing stuck off. </li>

  <li>We fixed the issue where Groove Music might show an error saying “Can’t play – Another app is controlling your sound right now”. </li>

  <li>When delayed lock is setup, Windows Hello will now say “Swipe up to dismiss the lock screen”, rather than looking for your iris. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where Glance wouldn’t be displayed when hovering hand over proximity sensor. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where multiple UWPs might start crashing on launch after getting stuck on their splash screen. </li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Other items of note</strong></h3>

<p>Just like <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/05/10/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14342/">we noted for Build 14342 for PC</a>, we have removed the Wi-Fi Sense feature that allows you to share Wi-Fi networks with your contacts and to be automatically connected to networks shared by your contacts. The engineering effort to keep this working great, combined with low demand for the feature made it not worthwhile to keep investing in it. Wi-Fi Sense, if enabled, will continue to get you connected to open Wi-Fi hotspots that it knows about through crowdsourcing.</p>

<p>As always – thank you for being Windows Insiders and make sure to send us feedback on any issues you run into with these builds in the <a href="http://aka.ms/windowsfeedbackapp">Feedback Hub</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks, 
  <br />g</p>
