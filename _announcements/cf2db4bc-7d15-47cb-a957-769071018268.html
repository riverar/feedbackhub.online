<p>Wallet tap to pay capabilities have been disabled due to a bug in OS build 14393.479.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Tap to pay will be fixed in the next Release Preview&nbsp;OS flight. You will need to re-add any credit cards that have been deleted.</p>

<p>We are sorry for any inconvenience this has caused and hope that you will continue to use Wallet for tap to pay.</p>
