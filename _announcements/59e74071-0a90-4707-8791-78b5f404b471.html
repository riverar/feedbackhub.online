<p><strong>Money and Sports apps:</strong> Version 4.16.14.0</p>

<p><b>Applicable Rings</b>: <strong>Fast</strong> Store update. Applicable for PC and Mobile.</p>

<p>With this update of the Money and Sports apps, we are excited to announce a change that has been highly anticipated by many of you: Dark mode</p>

<p>Dark mode applies for all pages throughout the app – you can turn it on and off by tapping the sun/moon icon in the app bar or via the settings page in the app. </p>

<p>We’ve also made some bug fixes and generally improved the reliability of these apps. </p>
