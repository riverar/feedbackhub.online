<p>Hello Windows Insiders!</p>

<p>Today we are releasing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 15025 for Mobile to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring.</p>

<h3><strong>What’s new in Build 15025 for Mobile</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Microsoft Edge can now read aloud:</strong> Microsoft Edge will now read aloud* your e-books just like on PC! Just press the “read aloud” button at the top-right corner after opening one of your e-books and listen to Microsoft Edge read you the book with focus on the line and the word being read along. This feature is also extended to all non-store EPUB files opened using Microsoft Edge.</p>

<p><em>*Supported languages: ar-EG, ca-ES, da-DK, de-DE, en-AU, en-CA, en-GB, en-IN, en-US, es-ES, es-MX, fi-FI, fr-CA, fr-FR, it-IT, ja-JP, nb-NO, nl-BE, nl-NL, pt-BR, pt-PT, sv-SE, tr-TR, zh-CN. </em></p>

<p><strong>Microsoft Edge and emoji:</strong> Microsoft Edge will now display full-color, updated emoji by default on websites that use emoji.</p>

<p><strong>Introducing Collections in Feedback Hub: </strong>A few months ago, we asked you what was one of your biggest pieces of feedback about the Feedback Hub. You said, “too many duplicate pieces of feedback!”. We love working with you to create a better experience for everyone using the Feedback Hub, so today we are so happy to announce Collections. Collections are now live in Feedback Hub starting with app version 1.1612.10251.0.</p>

<p><img alt="Collection icon for Feedback Hub." src="https://winblogs.azureedge.net/win/2017/02/collection-icon.png" width="112" height="103" /></p>

<p>A Collection groups together feedback for similar problems and suggestions into single items that bring together all the voices who expressed that sentiment in one place. All of your individual voices will be amplified when your feedback and upvotes are joined together into collections, and you’ll be able to see just how big your voice can become. Same as with individual feedback, you’ll be able to upvote Collections, upload screenshots to show the engineering team a problem you’re seeing or a suggestion you have, and comment on the feedback with others.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Insiders. Because of you, the Feedback Hub is becoming better for ALL customers.</p>

<p><strong>New mono audio option in Ease of Access settings:</strong> Visually impaired users use a screen reader application to read content on their phones and information to them, and frequently use headphones or earbuds to hear their device when in meetings or having conversations with others. When doing so, they generally use only one earbud to hear what’s being said from their device in one ear so the other ear is free to hear conversations and sounds around them. That can cause them to not hear sounds that may be directed to the other earbud. In order to change the sound to be mono mode and so all audio is directed to both ears, they used to need a physical earphone adapter. You can now switch your audio to mono straight from the new Audio section under <strong>Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Other</strong> options.</p>

<h3><strong>Other changes, improvements, and fixes for Mobile</strong></h3>

</ul>

<h3><strong>Known issues for Mobile</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Speech packs will be unable to download on this build. </li>

  <li>Adding a new card / paying with an existing card will not work in Microsoft Wallet. </li>

  <li>Microsoft Edge might sometimes unexpectedly not rotate into landscape mode. If this happens, try quickly locking and unlocking your phone. </li>

  <li>ADDED: Some Insiders have reported hitting error 80080008 when trying to download/install the update. We’ve discovered the cause of this issue and a fix is in the works, but won’t be available until a newer build is delivered. If you’re hitting this error currently, the workaround is simple: reboot your device and then re-scan for updates. <a href="https://aka.ms/80080008mu">For more, see this forum post. </a></li>
