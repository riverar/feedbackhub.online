<p>Photos App:&nbsp; 16.1017.10000.0 for PC and Mobile</p>

<p>Applicable Rings: <strong>Fast</strong> Store update</p>

<p>You can now harness the power of Windows Ink with your photos! Not only that, but when you save the ink, it replays what you drew, so you can share it as a still image or a video. Add funny comments or accessorize your friends – the sky’s the limit! To start inking, pick one of your favorite photos, and then tap the Draw option. You’ll now enter the familiar Windows Ink toolbar experience, where you can select a pen, pencil, and one new addition: a calligraphy pen! Once you finish inking, press the save button and the ink will dry, thus becoming part of the photo. This version of&nbsp;the Photos app&nbsp;also comes with an updated the cropping experience, and we’ve added a whole slew of new filters. Have fun, and we’d love to see what you end up inking – share your pictures with us <a href="https://twitter.com/windowsinsider">@windowsinsider</a>!</p>
