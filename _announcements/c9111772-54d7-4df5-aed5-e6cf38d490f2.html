<p>Hi everyone,&nbsp; </p>

<p>Today marks the one-year anniversary since we <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2014/09/30/announcing-windows-10/">first opened the Windows Insider Program</a>. This is a really happy moment for me personally, and a great milestone for the program. It has been amazing to see the impact that the Windows Insider Program has made to how we engineer Windows. The release of <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/07/28/windows-10-free-upgrade-available-in-190-countries-today/">Windows 10 the world 2 months ago</a>&nbsp;was made so much better because of your help and feedback throughout the year. Over the last 12 months, we’ve released 27 PC and mobile builds for you to try out and share your feedback, and you’ve seen the highs and lows of developing software with insights and transparency like never before. We continue to be humbled and grateful at the amount of effort and energy that Insiders bring to the program, and we hope that you’ve had a lot of fun along the way too. You got to see things first, try them early in their development, and shape the direction we went. You suggested ideas that made it into the release (and more to come!) and sent bug reports that allowed us to fix problems so that your friends and family running the final release could have a smoother experience. </p>

<p>We’re excited about year 2. Not only are we hard at work on getting new builds out to you for both PC and mobile – we’re also hard at work looking at ways to take the Windows Insider Program to the next level. We’ve recently added a <a href="windows-feedback:?contextid=532" target="_blank">Feedback category on the Windows Insider Program</a> for you to give us suggestions on what you’d like to see in the years ahead. </p>

<p>Thank you to all the Windows Insiders who have joined us to help make Windows awesome.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Thanks, </p>

<p>g </p>
