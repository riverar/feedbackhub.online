  <li>UPDATE: After your device reboots from installing this update, if it gets stuck as the Windows logo – let it sit and be patient. It might appear frozen but its still working in the background. While you wait, it is recommended you plug your phone in and let it charge as well. For more details – <a href="http://aka.ms/Lnbq0y">see this forum post</a>. </li>

  <li>We are investigating data issues with some Dual-SIM devices where cellular data doesn’t work correctly with a second SIM. Several issues relating to cellular data with Dual-SIM devices have been reported by Insiders with the last two Mobile builds and we’re investigating these reports. </li>

  <li>Feedback Hub is not localized and the UI will be in English (U.S.) only, even with language packs installed. </li>

  <li>We have reduced the number of instances where boxes are seen when entering emoji. You may still see them in some text fields – we’re working on it! </li>

  <li>The Settings app may crash when you are re-arranging Quick Actions under Settings &gt; System &gt; Notification &amp; actions. If it does, it could result in one of the Quick Action spots disappearing. If you see this happen, please refrain from changing your Quick Action settings on this build. If you have been impacted by this issue, only a hard reset will revert your Quick Action settings back to default.
