<p>Slow-motion video has been one of the most frequent requests we hear from people using the Camera app on Windows Phone and Windows 10. So, we’re happy to announce that you can now capture slow-motion video with Camera for Windows 10 on Lumia 930, Lumia 1520 and Lumia Icon phones. The latest Windows build now supports video capture of 120 fps in 720p resolution. To start capturing slow-motion video, select the <b>Video</b> button on the Camera screen, and then select the icon with the turtle.</p>

<p>To adjust your clips, select <b>Edit slow motion</b> when viewing the video in the Photos app. Trim your videos and play some parts back in normal speed and other parts in slow motion. Select <b>Super slow </b>to dramatically highlight a specific part of the video. </p>

<p>We hope existing Lumia phone customers will enjoy this new feature. With new Lumia devices available soon, you’ll be able to capture slow-motion videos with even better quality.</p>
