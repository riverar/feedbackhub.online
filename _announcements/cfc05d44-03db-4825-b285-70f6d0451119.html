<p>3D Scan App Update: version&nbsp;2.0.37.0 for PC&nbsp;</p>

<p>Applicable Rings: <strong>Fast</strong> and <b>Slow </b>Store update</p>

<p>3D Scan is a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app that turns your advanced sensor into a 3D scanner. 3D Scan builds on cutting-edge technology from Microsoft Research. This new approach offers better camera tracking, preserves scale of scanned objects, reduces graphics card requirements, improves overall framerate, significantly improves 3D mesh output, and captures higher quality color textures. We <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/kinectforwindows/2016/05/13/kinect-and-uwp-new-options-in-the-windows-10-anniversary-update/">updated the driver for Kinect One</a> to push rich sensor data through this new platform. You can use your Kinect One sensor to capture the world around you into 3D objects that you can personalize and even 3D print.</p>

<p>3D Scan builds on Windows 10 Anniversary Update’s <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.capture.aspx">Media Capture platform</a> that exposes depth and RGB data for advanced sensors. The Media Capture platform supports a wide-range of sensors. Currently, the platform and 3D Scan only work with the Kinect, but more sensors are coming soon!</p>

<p>3D Scan produces a complete 3MF file you can open in 3D Builder. The output is fully 3D printable. 3D Builder for Windows 10 provides the easiest way to 3D print. You don’t even need a 3D printer. You can 3D print to i.materialise.com in 20 different awesome materials and over 100 possible color and finish combinations (including full color).</p>
