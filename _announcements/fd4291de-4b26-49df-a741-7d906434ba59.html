<p>We have rolled out an update to the Windows Maps app which brings a highly anticipated feature: Windows Ink on Maps. This feature is optimized for pervasive ink annotations directly on the map with Surface Pen, and we have enabled inking with stylus, mouse, or touch.&nbsp;We are excited to get <a href="feedback-hub:?contextid=137">your feedback</a> and think you will enjoy Windows Ink on Maps as much as we do.</p>

<p>Here’s a few idea on how to get the most out of Windows Ink on Maps:</p>

<p>Use <b>ink annotations</b> in the Maps app to <b>create additional context or information about points of interest or an area of the map</b></p>

<p>Use the <b>Measure distance tool to plan a run, bike, or hiking route BEFORE you head out</b></p>

<p><b>Ink a contiguous line in Directions mode and Maps will calculate turn-by-turn directions</b> from the start to the end of the inked line</p>

<p>Use a <b>combination Ink annotations, Directions, and the Measure Distance tools together</b> to plan a meetup with friends and family</p>
