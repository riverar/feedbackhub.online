<p>We have a few known issues for Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 11099</p>

<ul>
  <li>Log on for devices using Citrix XenDesktop may be broken. It is recommended that Insiders that use XenDesktop skip this flight by moving to the Slow ring. </li>

  <li>Applications that depend on Adobe Flash may crash upon launch. This will affect some version of Skype, QQ, WeChat, etc. This does not affect Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer. </li>
</ul>
