<p>Hi everyone, </p>

<p>This is Michael Fortin, Corporate VP for Windows and Device Core Quality. We would like to welcome you, our Windows Insiders, to the November 2016 Windows 10 Bug Bash. Today we start the Bug Bash both internally within Microsoft as well as with Windows Insiders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Windows Insiders we want to welcome you in helping us find new bugs; and of course our developer will be busy working on fixing bugs over the next several weeks. The Bug Bash will conclude on Sunday November 13th, 11:59 PM PST.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with previous Bug Bashes, we are using Quests within <a href="http://aka.ms/windowsfeedbackapp">Feedback Hub</a> to identify different areas of the product to try out and give feedback. Throughout the week, we will cycle through new Quests and will bring them all back over the weekend for additional feedback before we conclude the Bug Bash. The first set of Quests for the November Bug Bash are <u><a href="https://aka.ms/fhquests">available here</a></u>. </p>

<p>Bug Bash build is&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/iapb51">14959</a> , which was released to Insiders last week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quests will be marked with:</p>

<p>· <b>ADVANCED Quests:</b></p>

<p>Quests marked as “ADVANCED” are more technical and may require changing the system configuration on your device and require an understanding on how to revert the changes after the Quest is done. You should only perform Quests that you feel comfortable doing, if something goes wrong you’ll need to be able to troubleshoot how to get back to a good state on your device.&nbsp;</p>

<p>· <b>UPDATE Quests:</b></p>

<p>Quests marked as “Update” exercise Update paths from Windows 10 Anniversary Update to the November 2016 Windows 10 Bug Bash build</p>

<p>· <b>DEVELOPER Quests:</b></p>

<p>Quests marked as “Developer Quests” specifically are designed for Developers and may require coding. </p>

<p>We also will be recognizing Windows Insiders for their participation in the Bug Bash by giving badges in Feedback Hub after the Bug Bash concludes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have lots of opportunities for Windows Insiders to participate in this Bug Bash. </p>

<p>Stay tuned to announcements and Quests in Feedback Hub over the course of the week for news and information. We can also be reached at our Twitter handle for any additional questions - <a href="https://twitter.com/windowsinsider">@WindowsInsider</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks again for participating in this Bug Bash. Our developers are busy finalizing the code on many of the features announced just a few weeks ago. We truly appreciate you helping make the upcoming Windows 10 Creator Update even better! If you have <a href="https://aka.ms/s5vf33">feedback on the November 2016 Windows Bug Bash</a>, let us know through Feedback Hub.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Michael Fortin</p>
