<h3>Hi everyone, </h3>

<p>Today, we are releasing Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview Build 14267 to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring. While we have been releasing preview builds for PC from our development branch for a while now, this is our first new preview build for Windows 10 Mobile from our Development Branch this year. As I mentioned <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/01/27/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14251/">a couple of weeks ago</a>, initially we’ll make new builds from our Development Branch available only to devices that shipped with Windows 10 Mobile. Currently this includes the Lumia 950, 950 XL, 550, 650, and Xiaomi Mi4. We plan to expand from there as we release Windows 10 Mobile to other devices. </p>

<p>Just to quickly recap the changes we’ve made to rings for Insiders in 2016: (I included this in yesterday’s PC build, but including here for Mobile for completeness):</p>

<ol>
  <li>We introduced the new Release Preview ring last week which is for Windows Insiders who want to stay on the Current Branch (currently builds based off of Build 10586), but continue to receive early access to updates, application updates, and driver updates. This is a great option for people who want to get updates early but not go all the way to installing full preview builds. Because the Release Preview ring offers updates to the Current Branch, it is only visible to devices on the Current Branch (Build 10586). If you are on a newer build, flights to the Release Preview ring won’t be applicable to that device. The easiest way to go between the Development Branch to the Current Branch on your phone is to use the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=522381">Windows Device Recovery Tool</a> for phone to reinstall Windows 10 Mobile. </li>

  <li>We’ve adjusted the criteria we use to release new builds to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring to get builds out more quickly – this means these builds may include more bugs and other issues that could be slightly more painful to live with. This applies to mobile builds just like it does for PC builds. So if you’d like to change your ring – open the Windows Insider app &gt; tap on “Get preview builds” &gt; Choose the Slow ring. </li>
</ol>

<h4><b>Here’s what’s new</b></h4>

<p><b>Search for music easier in Cortana:</b> We have made it easier to invoke music search in Cortana by adding a music search icon to the top right of Cortana. You can now open Cortana on your PC and click on the music search icon to have Cortana listen and search for the song that’s playing. </p>

<p><b>Word Flow now works in the address bar in Microsoft Edge on your phone:</b> For fans of Word Flow, we heard your feedback, and we have re-enabled the ability to use shape writing in the address bar in Microsoft Edge on your phone!</p>

<p><b>Open InPrivate tabs more easily in Microsoft Edge on your phone:</b> We take the need for private browsing seriously, and InPrivate has been a feature of Microsoft Edge in Windows 10 Mobile from day one. However, we received feedback from Windows Insiders that the InPrivate feature was either hard to find or missing on their phones. As a result, we’ve moved the button to create a new InPrivate tab to appear right next to the new tab button. The next time you need a private tab in Microsoft Edge, you’ll find it right in your tabs view. Try it out on your phone and let us know what you think. </p>

<p><b>Improved Download Prompts in Microsoft Edge: </b>You can now configure Microsoft Edge to show a prompt when you start a download, allowing you to choose where to save the file. Just open the Microsoft Edge settings pane (the three dots at the top right) and look for the option under “Downloads settings”. And on your phone, Microsoft Edge will now show a prompt when you start a download, allowing you to cancel unwanted downloads.</p>

<h4><b>Here’s what’s fixed</b></h4>

<ul>
  <li>We fixed an issue where shape writing would ignore every second word when typing into a text box on a website in Microsoft Edge. </li>

  <li>After installing the Polish keyboard, typing a word that should be accented now offers the recommended accented word. For example – if you type the word "milosc" it should properly autocorrect to "miłość". </li>

  <li>We have resolved an issue where you could not hide the navigation bar in Windows Phone 8.1 apps like WhatsApp, Twitter, Weibo, Flixster and others. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where videos recorded onto SD memory cards would result in a large number of dropped frames. </li>

  <li>There should be improved app launch reliability and certain crashes that were causing the phone to reboot are also fixed. </li>

  <li>We’ve polished the Live tile animations and improved the logic for refreshing Live tiles. </li>

  <li>We’ve made reliability improvements for keyboards with large dictionaries such as the Hinglish keyboard. </li>
</ul>

<p>As always – thank you for being Windows Insiders and make sure to send us feedback on any issues you run into with this build in the <a href="http://aka.ms/windowsfeedbackapp">Windows Feedback app</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks, 
  <br />g</p>
