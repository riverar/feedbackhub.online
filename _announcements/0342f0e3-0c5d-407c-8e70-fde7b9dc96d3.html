<p><strong>Describe your role with Microsoft and the Windows Insider Program</strong></p>

<p>My job in Microsoft is to ensure the quality of the Cortana and Search features. When something doesn’t work as we expected it is our job to gather sufficient logs and information for our devs to investigate, and it’s not just logs of what is happening but how many times its happening we need to give our issues a sense of priority. I also work as a Community Champ, gathering data directly from customers.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite app?</strong> </p>

<p>Netflix/Hulu</p>

<p><strong>Describe one of your favorite experiences with the Insider community. </strong></p>

<p>When Hey Cortana was first released in the January tech preview, it was still very buggy. There was a thread online where someone was complaining that they could not get it to work at all. I explained to the customer how they could get the feature to work and how to get their speech settings set up correctly. A day later they responded saying how grateful he was now that he was able to use this feature and do things like check the weather and calendar while having his hands full while cooking. That to me was the most rewarding experience. I was very happy to help our customers get the most out of our products, and help improve the quality of their life. </p>

<p><strong>What do you do outside of work?</strong> </p>

<p>I like doing a lot door things like running, going for long walks, blue berry picking. I also enjoy reading a good book over tea and doing yoga. </p>
