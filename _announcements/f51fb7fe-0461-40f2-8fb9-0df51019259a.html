<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>Today we announced that we have begun rolling out the November Update for Windows 10 to our 110+ million customers around the world. For more on today’s announcement, I suggest reading this <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/11/12/first-major-update-for-windows-10-available-today/" target="_blank">blog post from Terry</a>. We couldn’t have gotten here without the help of our Windows Insiders who have been testing new builds with us since we released Windows 10 in the summer. So thank you for helping us make Windows 10 awesome for our customers! </p>

<p>Thanks,
  <br />g</p>
