<p>By installing REACHit on your Windows 10 device, Cortana becomes even more personal.&nbsp; REACHit enables Cortana to know about your stuff even if it resides on other Windows 10 devices or 3rd party services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Exchange or Gmail.&nbsp; It also enables contextual search. </p>

<p>Here's what you need to know to get started:&nbsp; </p>

<ol>
  <li>You'll have to be in the US and running Windows 10 on a PC or Tablet&nbsp; </li>

  <li>You'll need to have Cortana already enabled and setup&nbsp; </li>

  <li>Download, install and setup instructions/videos are available from: <a href="http://invite.cortanareachit.com/">http://invite.cortanareachit.com/</a>&nbsp; </li>

  <li>Your feedback is essential.&nbsp; Feedback submission details are below&nbsp; </li>

  <li>Wait several hours before trying it out.&nbsp; Cortana and REACHit needs to index content, so if you can't get search results immediately, try it out again a few hours later, or the next day. </li>
</ol>

<p>What do we need you to do with the Cortana and REACHit Beta? </p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Enable different content sources, and actually use the device on a daily basis.</strong>&nbsp; For the Beta to have value, we need users doing things with files, sending / receiving emails, taking the device to different places, etc.&nbsp; If you install the Beta on a device and only use it sporadically, it will be far less valuable to you and the project team. Ideally, you’ll be using this on your primary work device.&nbsp; So carve out a little time to have fun, chat with Cortana, and use REACHit to find your stuff.&nbsp; To realize the full benefit of this integration, you need to enable different content sources like Google Drive, Dropbox, Gmail, Exchange mail, and your calendars as well as location awareness.&nbsp; You can do this in the REACHit settings, and the invite page contains a how-to video to make it simple.&nbsp; By enabling these things, Cortana and REACHit can help you find more of your stuff, using contextual clues like where you were or who you were with. </li>

  <li><strong>When you want to find your stuff, ask Cortana.</strong>&nbsp; Even if you know where things are, ask her.&nbsp; When you ask Cortana, ask her in a conversational way.&nbsp; For example – you want to find a budget spreadsheet you worked on last week.&nbsp; Don’t search for “budget spreadsheet”.&nbsp; Tell Cortana “Find the budget spreadsheet I worked on last week.” </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Examples of queries you can submit include: </p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <ul>
    <li>Find the email I sent Kate last week </li>

    <li>Find the email Kate sent me last Monday </li>

    <li>Where is the presentation I showed Mark? </li>

    <li>Find the Cynthia spreadsheet on Dropbox </li>

    <li>Find the Cynthia spreadsheet on this PC </li>

    <li>Find my tax files on Dropbox </li>

    <li>Find email Jeff sent me on Monday </li>

    <li>Find the MATLAB file I worked on yesterday </li>

    <li>Find the presentation I worked on at Starbucks </li>

    <li>Where are the files I worked on at Bull City Gymnastics? </li>
  </ul>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of your queries may not produce the results you want.&nbsp; This is expected at this stage – the Natural Language Understanding engine is young, and needs to be trained (that’s part of what you’re helping us to do).&nbsp; But keep asking!&nbsp; The more you use this, the better Cortana and REACHit will be. </p>

  <p>Example of this working on a Windows 10 insider build: </p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Provide feedback.</strong>&nbsp; We want to hear from you.&nbsp; We’ll get some metrics from the apps themselves, but we want to hear from you on how it’s going.&nbsp; Something didn’t work right?&nbsp; Have a suggestion for a feature or improvement?&nbsp; Let us know.&nbsp; You can do this by using the feedback link within Cortana or using the Windows Feedback app.&nbsp; Make sure you mention REACHit in your feedback, so we know it’s related to this beta. </p>

<p>If you need to uninstall REACHit you can do so from Control Panel\Programs\Programs and Features. </p>
