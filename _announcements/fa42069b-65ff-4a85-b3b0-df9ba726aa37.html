<p>Hi everyone, </p>

<p>Today we are sending out another Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview Build 10586 which we are releasing today to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring, Build 10586.107. This update includes some additional fixes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed an issue where in some cases a device could be missing tiles on the Start screen after going through the device out of box experience. </li>

  <li>Improved support in Narrator to speak in multiple languages. </li>

  <li>Improvements to the device reset experience when BitLocker\Device Encryption is enabled by enterprise policy or by the user. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Introducing the Release Preview Ring:</h3>

<p>Today we are introducing a new ring named the Windows Insider Release Preview ring for both PC and mobile. The Release Preview ring will focus on Insiders that want to stay on the Current Branch (currently builds based off of 10586), but continue to receive early access to updates, application updates, and driver updates. </p>

<p>The 3 Windows Insider rings are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Fast</b> - Best for Insiders who enjoy being the first to get access to builds and feature updates, with some risk to their devices in order to identify issues, and provide suggestions and ideas to make Windows software and devices great. </li>

  <li><b>Slow</b> -Best for Insiders who enjoy getting early access to builds and feature updates, with less risk to their devices, and still want to provide feedback to make Windows software and devices great. </li>

  <li><b>Release Preview -</b> Best for Insiders who enjoy getting early access to updates for the Current Branch, Microsoft applications, and drivers, with minimal risk to their devices, and still want to provide feedback to make Windows devices great. </li>
</ul>
