<p>Hi Windows Insiders,</p>

<p>Earlier this week we kicked off the November 2016 Bug Bash to Windows Insiders on Windows 10 preview build <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/11/03/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14959-for-mobile-and-pc/">14959</a> and <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/11/09/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14965-for-mobile-and-pc/">14965</a> for PC and Mobile. Over the week, we have received great feedback from our Windows Insiders and our engineers are actively triaging this feedback and taking note of things we want to fix. We wanted to thank you for participating in this Bug Bash and providing great feedback. </p>

<p>Just like previous Bug Bashes, all the <a href="https://aka.ms/fhquests">Bug Bash Quests</a> are now back in Feedback Hub&nbsp;for the weekend. So there&nbsp;is another chance to join us as we also bash over the weekend. </p>

<p>We will be live streaming Bug Bush Quests at <a href="https://beam.pro/WindowsInsider">https://beam.pro/WindowsInsider</a> this weekend if you want to join us in completing Quests together. We will be online Saturday November 12th from 1-3PM PST (<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=what+is+1+pm+PST+in+UTC&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;pq=what+is+1+pm+pst+in+utc&amp;sc=1-23&amp;sp=-1&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=2725AFD9F9134C7593248AD99CA3113C">21:00 UTC</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Known Issue for Quest:</strong></p>
