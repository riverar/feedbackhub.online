<p>On 12/14 Skype Preview version 11.10.146 was released to all Insiders. There has been many reports of users experiencing crashes upon app start. We just wanted to let you know that we are aware of the issue and have already identified the root cause. The fix, Skype Preview version 11.10.147.0, is already available for Insiders on the Fast ring and will be rolling out to Insiders on Slow and Release preview soon. Apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused and thanks for reporting it to us. </p>
