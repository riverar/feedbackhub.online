<p>Hello Windows Insiders!</p>

<p>Changing the Windows display language or adding support for a second language in Windows is an important feature for many of you.&nbsp; You can access the language settings by going to Settings -&gt; Time &amp; language -&gt; Region &amp; language and select a language from more than 100 languages.</p>

<p>The localization team have heard you loud and clear. We took your feedback to the feature team responsible for language settings and the feature team agreed that this part of Settings can be improved.</p>

<p>Text was added to the Languages dialog that explains the effect of the order of languages in the language profile:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adding a language will add input support for that language to your computer. </li>

  <li>Moving the language to the top of the language list signals that apps and websites should display in that language </li>

  <li>Setting a language as Windows display language will add the language pack to your computer and the Windows UI language will change after signing out and signing in again </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Add a language dialog, you can now search for your language by native name or the localized name or by entering the language code. Try: “nl” for Dutch or “tlh-Latn” for Klingon!</p>

<p>You can jump to the language you want by typing the first letter of the language name and scrolling through the list of languages has been improved.</p>

<p>Changes were made to the default language settings as well: the login page now defaults to the default input method to resolve issues with accidental lock out.</p>
