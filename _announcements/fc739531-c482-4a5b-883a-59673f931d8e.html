<p>Program Manager, OS Fundamentals, Windows and Devices Group</p>

<p><b>What is the one word that describes how you work?</b></p>

<p>Cheerfully! </p>

<p><b>Where did you grow up?&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Roanoke, Virginia</p>

<p><b>Describe your role with Microsoft and the Windows Insider Program.</b></p>

<p>A fundamental part of the culture of Windows is to live our lives on the freshest builds of Windows so that we intimately understand how our changes impact its use. I support employees as they upgrade to new builds of Windows and provide feedback to the teams who have introduced changes.</p>

<p><b>What technologies do you work on?</b></p>

<p>Any product that contains the word "Windows" in the title. Previously I was focused on our media apps, Groove and Movies &amp; TV.</p>

<p><b>What’s your favorite feature on Windows 10?</b></p>

<p>Ah, but there are soooo many good ones! Honestly, the one that stands out is the ability to quickly control the playback device by clicking on the Volume icon in the taskbar. I like to listen to music while I work and I’m constantly switching between the onboard speakers, a little Tivoli desk radio that I’ve had for years, and my beloved Marshall headphones. </p>

<p><b>Describe one of your favorite experiences with the Insider community.</b></p>

<p>In my previous role, I spent a lot of time on Twitter with the biggest fans of the Groove and Movies &amp; TV apps. It was super fun! I also got to present the roadmap for those apps in the annual MVP Summit on campus. Hanging out with Windows Insiders is ALWAYS so much fun!</p>

<p><b>Without your phone or computer, what gadgets can't you live without and why? </b></p>

<p>I have analog clocks in every room of my house and in my office. There is something about “seeing” the time that helps me stick to my schedule. </p>

<p><b>What is your current work setup? </b></p>

<p>I use a Surface Pro 3, connected to a docking station, with an external 24” monitor. I also have a ton of phones!</p>

<p><b>What is your twitter or social media account that you can be reached at? </b></p>

<p>@ellenment </p>

<p><b>How do you start your day? </b></p>

<p>Walking my dogs! I have a French Bulldog/Boston Terrier mix and a baby Pug. </p>

<p><b>What do you like about life on campus? </b></p>

<p>I have been lucky enough to work very close to our Commons, a huge cafeteria with a ton of great food options. I love being able to eat something different every day AND see colleagues from other teams who don’t work in my building. It keeps me connected. </p>

<p><b>What is your most memorable moment at Microsoft? </b></p>

<p>In recent history, it was being in the room with Terry Myerson and our flighting teams as Windows 10 started to roll out worldwide. The energy in that room as the number of Windows 10 installs started to go up was something I’ll never forget. </p>

<p><b>What is your favorite food or restaurant? </b></p>

<p>Thai!!!!!</p>

<p><b>What do you do outside of work? </b></p>

<p>I spend a lot of time with my little boy. He’s seven and halfway through the 1<sup>st</sup> grade. When I venture out at night it’s always to see live music somewhere. The number of top notch venues in Seattle blows my mind. </p>

<p><b>What is your favorite tip for Windows? </b></p>

<p>I am so thankful for the Multitasking settings that make the use of snapped windows sooooo much easier. The way windows automatically resize is so convenient. </p>
