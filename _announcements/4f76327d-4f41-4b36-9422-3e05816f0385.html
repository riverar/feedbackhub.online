<p><strong>Describe your role with Microsoft and the Windows Insider Program</strong></p>

<p>As a Program Manager I help the team define and prioritize the plans for the features included in apps, collaborating with engineers, other program managers in the team, designers, user research, user assistance and other teams to deliver apps that users will love. </p>

<p><strong>What technologies do you work on?</strong></p>

<p>I work on the apps team for Windows, specifically in the Maps app and the driving directions functionality</p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite feature on Windows 10?</strong></p>

<p>Windows Hello, making it easier for me to securely log in to my devices and greeting me with a Hello makes me smile</p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite app?</strong></p>

<p>Maps of course. &nbsp;I also love OneNote and having the ability to write down my notes, thoughts and to-do’s from any of my devices easily and have them available everywhere and easy to organize. </p>

<p><strong>Describe one of your favorite experiences with the Insider community</strong></p>

<p>It is inspiring to see the willingness of the community to help by gathering info and trying different things to investigate and solve issues, just interacting in the forums and being able to directly listen to our customers both in their pain, suggestions and delights is great and I love whenever I find happy customers enjoying our work or happier customers getting fixes to issues they had. I worked with one user that helped us discover the app was not available in some markets through the store and we were able to quickly fix that once we narrowed down the issue. </p>

<p><strong>What do you do outside of work?</strong> </p>

<p>I volunteer my time to leverage my abilities and passions. I spend time helping a local animal shelter and also foster cats and dogs at home to help them become adoptable. I also volunteer with KIND to leverage my bilingual knowledge to help others. </p>
