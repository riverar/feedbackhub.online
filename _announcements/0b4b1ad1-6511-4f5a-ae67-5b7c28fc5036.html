<p><strong>Feedback Hub</strong> app: Version 1.1608.2441.0 </p>

<p>Applicable Rings: <strong>Fast</strong> Store update</p>

<p>With this update of Feedback Hub app we are excited to announce a change that has been highly anticipated by many of you: Dark mode for Feedback Hub. </p>

<p>Dark mode applies for all pages throughout the app - for example, the home page for the app looks like this: </p>
