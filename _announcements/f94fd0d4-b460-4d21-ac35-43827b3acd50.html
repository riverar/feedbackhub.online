<p>Program Manager Intern</p>

<p><strong>What is the one word that describes how you work?</strong></p>

<p>[I can only work with] caffeine</p>

<p><strong>How many years at Microsoft?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just started as an intern this May</p>

<p><strong>Where did you grow up? </strong></p>

<p>Born and raised in Waterloo, Ontario in Canada</p>

<p><strong>Describe your role with Microsoft and the Windows Insider Program:</strong> </p>

<p>I'm a Program Manager intern here at Microsoft for the summer and I'm exploring possible strategies in improving the Windows Insider Program. My summer starts with research and hopefully ends with a working prototype!</p>

<p><strong>What technologies do you work on?</strong></p>

<p>As a PM intern, my role is more focused on research, gathering feedback, developing specifications and some low-fidelity mockups, so I'm not too involved with technologies.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite feature on Windows 10?</strong></p>

<p>Using search with Cortana is awesome. I love being able to open programs and quickly access files that way. It's my go-to for finding anything, and I'm really happy that search is moving in such a more powerful direction.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite app?</strong> </p>

<p>I really like Outlook Calendar. I rely on it so much every day, and I really like its clean interface. I like the little touches, such as how it shows the weather for the day.</p>

<p><strong>Describe one of your favorite experiences with the Insider community:</strong> </p>

<p>I haven't gotten to meet many of you yet! Hopefully I can work with you guys soon!</p>

<p><strong>With gadget can't you live without your PC or Phone?</strong></p>

<p>I love having a running watch. It really reduces the burden of carrying around a clunky phone around while running, and is super useful for races to track my progress and pace.</p>

<p><strong>What is your current work setup?</strong> </p>

<p>I have a pretty simple setup. Just my Surface Pro 4 with two Dell monitors.</p>

<p><strong>How do you start your day?</strong> </p>

<p>I start my day by napping on the bus on my commute from Seattle. Once I get to work, I need my cup of coffee. I have a caffeine addiction but that's okay, I'm still a student. Then, I put on my Spotify and I'm good to go!</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite thing in Microsoft Kitchen?</strong> </p>

<p>Oh my goodness there are so many great things to eat. I gotta say there's a really great creamy smoked salmon pasta made with house made penne. Actually, I think that Microsoft just generally does an awesome job at salmon.</p>

<p>THE FOOD. There are an insane amount of options on campus for food. Whatever you want for lunch whether its sushi, made to order steak, burgers, or a fancy three course meal you can find it all on campus. I'm trying to eat something different every day.</p>

<p><strong>What do you do outside of work?</strong> </p>

<p>I'm trying to learn hip hop and some street styles this summer. Hopefully by the end of this summer I'll be less embarrassed at myself! Dance is nice because it doesn’t feel like you're working out, and it’s a great way to build confidence.</p>
