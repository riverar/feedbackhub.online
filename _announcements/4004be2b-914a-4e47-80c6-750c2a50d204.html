<ul>
  <li>Language and speech packs are unable to be downloaded and will show errors due to a backend issue. </li>

  <li>We’re investigating a crash with the Camera app when going into your camera roll. </li>

  <li>There is an issue in which you may see duplicate apps under All apps showing as pending despite being installed and usable on your phone. You may also see some apps stuck in the Store. </li>

  <li>You may see square boxes in certain apps when using some of the new emoji – we’re still getting support for the new emoji added throughout the systems, this will be resolved in a future build. </li>

  <li>In some cases, users might get in a state where neither space or enter are working on the keyboard. If that happens, pressing and holding one of the apps in the All apps list until a context menu appears may resolve the issue. If this doesn’t work, you will need to reboot.</li>
</ul>
