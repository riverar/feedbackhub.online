<p><strong>Windows 10 Team Profile</strong></p>

<p>To give you even more insight into Windows 10, we’d like to introduce you to some of the people on our team and how they support the platform – and Windows Insiders like you. We’ll feature team profiles on an ongoing basis here in the Hub.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew van Eerde, Senior Software Engineer</strong></p>

<p><strong>Describe your role with Microsoft and the Windows Insider Program</strong></p>

<p>I work on the Windows audio quality team. My blog is at <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/matthew_van_eerde/">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/matthew_van_eerde/</a>.&nbsp; Back in the day, I wrote code that tried to break things, and when I couldn’t break things anymore, we shipped.&nbsp; Nowadays, I write code and reports that says how well things are working, which is infinitely cooler, because I can triangulate and discover the existence of all sorts of interesting bugs.</p>

<p>Sometimes our reports miss things – everything’s green, but stuff is actually broken. That’s where the Windows Insiders are a tremendous help! I judge our reports by their ability to predict the feedback of the Insiders.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite app? </strong></p>

<p>BaconIt for Windows Phone 8, a Reddit viewer <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/baconit/9wzdncrfj0bc">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/baconit/9wzdncrfj0bc</a></p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite feature on Windows 10?</strong></p>

<p>Gapless audio playback! The last version of Windows that allowed seamless playback of an audio album in the default media player was Windows 98 Second Edition, via the CD Player.</p>

<p><strong>Describe one of your favorite experiences with the Insider community</strong></p>

<p>One of things that Insiders have asked for is that Windows Store apps be added to the Windows “volume mixer” (right-click the speaker next to the clock; Open Volume Mixer.)&nbsp; One of the Insiders who was a developer saw this, but didn’t want to wait, so they made their own UI: <a href="https://twitter.com/WithinRafael/status/619811243990224896">https://twitter.com/WithinRafael/status/619811243990224896</a> <a href="https://github.com/File-New-Project/EarTrumpet">https://github.com/File-New-Project/EarTrumpet</a></p>

<p><strong>What do you do outside of work?</strong></p>

<p>I hang out on the Free Internet Chess Server – <a href="http://www.freechess.org/">http://www.freechess.org/</a>.&nbsp; I also try to solve some of the interesting math problems on Project Euler – <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">http://projecteuler.net/</a></p>
