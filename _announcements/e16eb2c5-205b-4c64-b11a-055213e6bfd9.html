<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>This is Michael Fortin, Corporate VP for Windows and Devices Core Quality and Anita George, leader of the Bug Bash for the Windows and Devices Group. We would like to welcome the Windows Insiders to the February 2017 Windows 10 Creators Update Bug Bash. Today, Friday February 3rd, we start the Bug Bash both internally within Microsoft as well as with Windows Insiders.</p>

<p>Thank you to all the Insiders that have participated in past Bug Bashes, and returning or new participants in this upcoming one. Your feedback is very valuable to us and helps shape Windows 10! As you enter your feedback, our developers will be busy working on fixing many of these issues over the next several weeks. The Bug Bash will conclude on Sunday February 12th, 11:59 PM PST.</p>

<p>Along with the instructions below, here is a video describing what you can expect for this Bug Bash.</p>

<p>If you are in the Fast ring, we encourage you to Bug Bash on the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 15025 (<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/02/01/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-15025-pc/">click here to read about Build 15025 for PC</a> and <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/02/02/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-15025-mobile/">click here to read about Build 15025 for Mobile</a>).</p>
