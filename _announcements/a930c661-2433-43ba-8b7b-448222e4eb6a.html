<p>We’ve continued to pump out updates for the Groove app for Windows 10 every few weeks or so. We’ve released a special one for Window Insiders. We’re finally done “tuning our instruments” - Radio and Explore are now available in version 3.6.1299.0 of the app. You can now use the Radio feature to create instant playlists based on your favorite artists. </p>

<p>You can now use this first version of Explore to browse, search, and play our full music catalog, right in the app! We’re working on a few more additions for Explore with the next update. We can’t wait to hear what you think about these new features!</p>
