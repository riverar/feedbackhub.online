<p><b>New</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>When you've completed something in your notes, you can now strike it out by highlighting the text and hitting Ctrl+T. Done! </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Fixed</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Prefer to keep your notes compact and small in size? You can now change their color without having to make them larger. </li>

  <li>Fun fact: It's estimated that over 40% of the world is bilingual. If that includes you, we fixed a bug that would show you the incorrect smart insights when switching your keyboard language. </li>

  <li>Your Sticky Notes app was getting a little confused if you were using alt to create special letters or characters that you needed. That bug is now officially squashed! </li>

  <li>We heard that some of you were seeing the app crash when highlighting text and then typing. Sorry, it's all fixed now. </li>
</ul>
