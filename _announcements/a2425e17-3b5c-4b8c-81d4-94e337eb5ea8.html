<p>Hello Windows Insiders!</p>

<p>Today we are excited to be releasing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 15042 for PC and Build 15043 for Mobile to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring. <del>We have discovered a bug that impacts our ability to release this build to PCs running 32-bit (x86) versions of Windows 10 Insider Preview builds. Because the majority of Insiders in the Fast ring have PCs running 64-bit (x64) – we decided to go ahead and release this build with 32-bit PCs blocked until our next flight.</del> UPDATE: PCs running 32-bit (x86) versions of Windows 10 Insider Preview builds should be able to receive this build just fine! We fixed the bug. <strong>Also – please read the known issues below.</strong></p>

<h3>What’s new in Build 15042</h3>

<p><strong>New Cortana animation in OOBE (PC):</strong> We know how much you love animations, so we wanted to share with you our updated Cortana persona that you’ll see when you land on the Cortana page in OOBE:</p>

<p><strong>Prompt to enable Flash in Microsoft Edge (PC):</strong> Back in Build 15002, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2016/12/14/edge-flash-click-run/">we introduced click-to-run Flash</a> by default in Microsoft Edge, for better security and performance across the Web. In today’s build, we’ve added a new dialog in the URL bar to make it clearer when Flash content has been blocked. Just click the puzzle icon to allow Flash once or every time you return to the same site.</p>

<p><strong>Improved reading experience with Microsoft Edge:</strong> You loved the new Edge reading experience and gave us a TON of feedback. Here are some we implemented:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When reading a locally saved EPUB book in Microsoft Edge on PC, a book icon will now be used in the place of the previous generic in the tab bar.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="https://winblogs.azureedge.net/win/2017/02/book-icon.png" width="326" height="193" /><b></b><i></i><u></u></p>

<ul>
  <li>If you switch pages while an EPUB book is being read aloud in Microsoft Edge, the reader will now jump to that new location in the book. </li>

  <li>If you’ve changed the read aloud settings when reading an EPUB in Microsoft Edge, those settings will now be preserved for subsequently opened books.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other changes, improvements, and fixes for PC</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You should no longer see “Initializing…” when attempting to download new builds. </li>

<h3>Known issues for PC</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A small percentage of PCs may fail to update to this build due to a corrupt registry key. If your PC appears to be at the spinning dots black screen during boot for an unusual amount of time while updating to this build, hard reboot your PC and then run the following commands in an admin Command Prompt: 
    <p><code>reg delete HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\setup\upgrade\nsimigrationroot /f</code></p>

    <p><code></code></p>

    <p><code>netsh int ipv6 set locality state=disabled</code></p>

    <p><code></code></p>

    <p><code>reg delete HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nsi\{eb004a01-9b1a-11d4-9123-0050047759bc}\28 /f</code></p>

    <p>For more information on this issue, <a href="http://aka.ms/15042pcinstall">see this forum post</a>.</p>
  </li>

  <li>While we fixed the primary bug causing this issue, some Windows Insiders may still hit nonstop exceptions in the Spectrum.exe service causing their PC to lose audio, disk I/O usage to become very high, and apps like Microsoft Edge to become unresponsive when doing certain actions such as opening Settings. As a workaround to get out of this state, STOP the Spectrum.exe service and delete C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Spectrum\PersistedSpatialAnchors and reboot. For more details, <a href="https://aka.ms/15007pcaudio">see this forum post</a>. </li>

  <li>[GAMING] Some popular games might minimize to the taskbar when launched. You can click on the game on the taskbar to get the game back. </li>

  <li>[GAMING] Certain hardware configurations may cause the broadcast live review window in the Game bar to flash Green while you are Broadcasting. This does not affect the quality of your broadcast and is only visible to the Broadcaster. </li>

  <li>Microsoft Edge F12 tools may intermittently crash, hang, and fail to accept inputs. </li>

  <li>The icon for Windows Insider Program under Settings &gt; Update &amp; security is shown as a square. </li>

  <li>Windows Hello face authentication might not work, showing a “Camera couldn’t turn on” error on the lock screen, on some Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book devices</li>
</ul>

<h3>Known issues for Mobile</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Speech packs will be unable to download on this build. </li>

  <li>Adding a new card / paying with an existing card will not work in Microsoft Wallet.</li>
</ul>
