<p>To give you even more insight into Windows 10, we’d like to introduce you to some of the people on our team and how they support the platform – and Windows Insiders like you. We’ll feature team profiles on an ongoing basis here in the Hub.</p>

<h1><b>Brandon LeBlanc</b></h1>

<p><b>How many years at Microsoft:</b> 7 years and 1 month. </p>

<p><b>Where did you grow up?&nbsp;</b>I'm native to the Pacific Northwest and grew up in a small town outside of Portland, OR. </p>

<p><b>Describe your role with Microsoft and the Windows Insider Program</b></p>

<p>I am responsible for pulling together all kinds of content for Windows Insiders that appear in blog posts on the Windows Blog and in the Insider Hub! For example - I work to pull together what's new in any builds we flight to Windows Insiders. </p>

<p><b>What technologies do you work on?</b> </p>

<p>I don't really work on a specific "technology" - I am mostly content focused. </p>

<p><b>What’s your favorite feature on Windows 10?</b> </p>

<p>I absolutely LOVE Start with Cortana. With Live tiles, I can pull up Start at any given moment while working at my PC to see what's going on with the news or weather or any tweets I may have missed. And Cortana gives me the ability to quickly access information too that I need throughout my day. </p>

<p><b>What’s your favorite app?</b> </p>

<p>I'm a news junkie and really love the USA Today app for Windows 10. I heavily use the app on all my Windows 10 PCs and on my Lumia 950! The Twitter app for Windows 10 is a close second place favorite! </p>

<p><b>Describe one of your favorite experiences with the Insider community</b></p>

<p>I have too many favorite experiences to be able to just name one. I did use the Microsoft Translator app for Windows 10 to interact with a Windows Insider from Portugal the other day in Portuguese which was very cool! Windows Insiders are "my people" as our biggest fans of Windows and I am such a big fan of Windows too! </p>

<p><b>Without your phone or computer, what gadgets can't you live without and why?</b> </p>

<p>My Leica T camera because I love taking photos. </p>

<p><b>What is your current work setup?</b> </p>

<p>I've got a HP Z400 workstation that's got some pretty beefy specs with a 34-inch ultra-widescreen Dell monitor and then a Alienware Alpha PC I use for testing among some laptops like the Dell XPS 13 and HP Spectre X360 along with a few Surfaces. </p>
