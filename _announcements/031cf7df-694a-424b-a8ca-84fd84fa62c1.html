<p>Skype App: version 11.9.261 for PC and Mobile</p>

<p>Applicable Ring(s): Windows Insider <strong>Fast</strong>&nbsp;Store update </p>

<p>Fixes in this flight:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We fixed an issue where replying straight from the Skype Preview IM notification would sometimes not result in the message being sent </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where the section of conversations “older than a week” would disappear after Skype Preview had been suspended and resumed </li>

  <li>We disabled the “Send File” button on Desktop when sending SMS messages, as that’s not currently a supported scenario for SMS </li>
</ul>
