<p>To give you even more insight into Windows 10, we’d like to introduce you to some of the people on our team and how they support the platform – and Windows Insiders like you. We’ll feature team profiles on an ongoing basis here in the Hub.</p>

<p><strong>Jeremy Mohn – Software Engineer II</strong></p>

<p><strong>Describe your role with Microsoft and the Windows Insider Program</strong></p>

<p>I am a Software Engineer and a Community Champion for the Maps team in Windows.&nbsp; My job is to gather feedback, analyze data and then work with our team to make sure we are focusing on the right set of issues our customers are reporting.&nbsp; I also work in educating our team in how to properly listen and understand customer feedback as part of our daily work life.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>What technologies do you work on?</strong></p>

<p>My teams focus is on delivering a high quality set of map controls and services for developers to use in their apps.&nbsp; We are constantly working to improve developers experiences building on our software and services.&nbsp; I specifically focus on monitoring our platform services (search, directions, traffic, geocoding, etc) on devices across the world.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite feature on Windows 10?</strong></p>

<p>Xbox streaming, to be able to stream my Xbox One from my basement to my Surface running Windows 10 in the bedroom is awesome.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite app? </strong></p>

<p>Maps! One of my favorite experiences is sitting with my kids on the couch and exploring the world.&nbsp; They love picking a location and then zooming all the way in to find all the cities and landmarks.&nbsp; 3D and Streetside are super cool as well.&nbsp; Outside of Maps I spend quite a bit of time in Visual Studio and way too much time on Reddit in Edge. J</p>

<p><strong>Describe one of your favorite experiences with the Insider community</strong></p>

<p>One of the great things about working with Windows Insiders is being able to loop back after some of their feedback has been addressed via the Windows Feedback app. &nbsp;We get valuable feedback (both good and bad) from Insiders who get to try the new features first. &nbsp;I also think it is pretty cool to see feedback come in as raw data, get translated to actual code and then shipped in an update.&nbsp; We are passionate about Maps and having a passionate group of Insiders giving us feedback just helps us make better experiences.</p>

<p><strong>What do you do outside of work?</strong></p>

<p>My wife and I have 2 year old twins at home, so outside of work they are my focus.&nbsp; We go on hikes, go to the park and they love to help cook.&nbsp; I like to go running and biking to get some exercise.&nbsp; I am also a huge fan of the Seattle Seahawks and the University of Oregon Ducks. </p>
