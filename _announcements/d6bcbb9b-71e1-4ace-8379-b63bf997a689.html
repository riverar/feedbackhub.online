<p>We have released a Cumulative Update (KB3176927) to Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14393 on PCs and Mobile devices which will bring the build number to 14393.5. This Cumulative Update includes a handful of fixes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We have improved reliability and performance of Microsoft Edge with AdBlock and LastPass extensions enabled. These extensions should continue to work after installing other extension updates from the Store. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue causing battery to drain due to runaway CPU processes while a device is idle. We also fixed a battery life issue due to the proximity sensor always running on some devices. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue causing Store apps to stop launching due to a licensing issue.</li>

  <li>We have fixed an issue that results in Windows Updates being delayed on systems with Connected Standby.</li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where the Korean IME would not have the correct composition on some custom TSF3 edit controls on PC. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where you might not be able to type in text into Search or some Store apps without having to restart the process. </li>

  <li>We have fixed an issue where keyboard input on some Windows tablet devices would not rotate to landscape normally.</li>
</ul>
