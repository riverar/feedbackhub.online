<p>UPDATE 12/2: We are getting ready to start releasing PC builds to Insiders <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/11/03/introducing-unified-update-platform-uup/#1zLoIGDEt6AJCbE2.97">using UUP</a>. To prepare for this, we are going to pause all PC builds for both the Fast and Slow rings starting this evening (Friday 12/2). We will begin flighting the latest builds via UUP starting with our internal rings first then to Insiders based on each ring’s promotion criteria. We’re excited to be able to release builds for PC to Insiders using UUP!&nbsp;Mobile builds are not impacted by this.</p>
