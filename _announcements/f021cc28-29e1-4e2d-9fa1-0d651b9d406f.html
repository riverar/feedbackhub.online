<p><strong>Describe your role with Microsoft and the Windows Insider Program</strong></p>

<p>I’m a Data Analysis PM in Localization WDG team. As the Localization team is the central team for technical and cultural understanding of international customer needs, I advocate for building efficient data analytics to detect international customer pain points. Once identified, I help map the data to scenario improvements in order to increase customer delight.</p>

<p><strong>What technologies do you work on?</strong></p>

<p>For international data analysis, I use technologies for both subjective user feedback and objective project telemetry data analysis. The Community channel is one of the main subjective data sources used to monitor international user delight on localized versions of Windows. Once analyzed, this data provides insights into international customer usage patterns, allowing us to improve products across all markets.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite feature on Windows 10?</strong></p>

<p>I love the search integration feature with Cortana. Basically I do everything through search, including launching apps, searching for files, and of course web searches as well. I use Cortana on both Desktop and Phone.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite app? </strong></p>

<p>My favorite app is the Windows Feedback app. I enjoy seeing customers’ suggestions and feedback (both problems and delights). As I’m fluent in Korean, I especially enjoy reading the Korean feedback. &nbsp;I also like to participate and provide my own feedback to improve the products.</p>

<p><strong>Describe one of your favorite experiences with the Insider community</strong></p>

<p>I received localization quality feedback from both the community channel and the Windows Feedback app. I raised the issue immediately and&nbsp;the fix was delivered in next flight release. I’m so happy when we can share information about fixes with the insider community.</p>

<p><strong>What do you do outside of work?</strong></p>

<p>I like cooking. I often spend time searching for and trying out popular recipes. I love recipes for Thai, Japanese, Korean, French, and other international cuisines.</p>
