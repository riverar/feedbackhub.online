<p>As we prepare for the public release of Windows 10, pre-release product keys will no longer activate Insider Preview.</p>

<p>For Enterprise editions, starting with Build 10240, you’ll need to activate with your organization’s Volume License keys (KMS or MAK) or VL keys acquired via MSDN subscription. VL keys will be made available via Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC) and MSDN soon, stay tuned. </p>
