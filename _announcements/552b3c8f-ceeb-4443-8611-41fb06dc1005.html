<p>· You can use your voice to navigate the app on Xbox One consoles.</p>

<p>· You can select items in the app with a single click now.</p>

<p>· Sign in will work more reliability because we changed the way we check your region.</p>

<p>· We did work to ensure the correct track title and album title are displayed in playlists you follow.</p>

<p>· The Navigation Pane in Groove Music on Xbox One console has been resized to fit better on average sized screens.</p>

<p>· We updated the way we create version numbers so that it’s easier for us to tell when a version was produced just by looking at the version number – this one was built in the second half of September 2016 so 16092. </p>

<p>Thanks for your support. We look forward to reading your feedback!</p>
