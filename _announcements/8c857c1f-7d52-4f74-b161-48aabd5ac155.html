<p>Hello from the Windows Insider Engineering team!</p>

<p>We are excited to again include you, the Windows Insiders, in the June 2016 Windows 10 Anniversary Update&nbsp;Bug Bash. We are kicking off the Bug Bash internally today as well so we are starting on this together. Similar to the last Bug Bash, this week our teams are focused on filing feedback submissions &amp; up-votes alongside Windows Insiders. We will again be reviewing incoming feedback from Windows Insiders and Microsoft engineers, prioritizing the problems being reported, and fixing bugs based on your feedback. </p>

<p>If you have been installing Insider builds along the way between the Bug Bash in April and last week’s release to the Fast ring, you’ve noticed the wide variety of feature introductions, OS changes, and application updates that have been delivered. Today's release of <a href="https://aka.ms/wipbugbash2">14366 for PC and 14364 for Mobile</a> continues this experience and is the Bug Bash Build. Your ongoing feedback, as we saw <a href="insiderhub://announcements/821e9789-2757-4686-a1b6-2f8128da4eb4?Source=ShareLink">in April Bug Bash</a>, has been vital in bug discovery as well as insights into what changes we can bring in to make Windows 10 an even greater experience for our Customers.</p>

<p>Given the overwhelming response to the variety and number of Quests delivered in the previous Bug Bash, we will once again be using this feature of the <a href="http://aka.ms/windowsfeedbackapp">Feedback hub</a> both with our internal Microsoft engineers and Windows Insiders to help highlight different areas of the product to give feedback on. The first set of Quests for the June Bug Bash are <u>available here</u>.</p>

<p>We will be cycling Quests over the next 4 days so that we can highlight different area to focus on each day. However we will be bringing all of them back over the weekend for more feedback. The end time for the June Bug Bash is June 19th, 11:59 PM PST.</p>

<p>Once again Quests will be marked with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>LIMITED TIME Quests:</strong> </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quests marked as “LIMITED TIME” will expire within 24hrs of being published so make sure you get to these before the time runs out and they’re replaced with new Quests. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ADVANCED Quests:</strong> </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quests marked as “ADVANCED” are more technical and may require changing the system configuration on your device and require an understanding on how to revert the changes after the Quest is done. You should only perform Quests that you feel comfortable doing, if something goes wrong you’ll need to be able to troubleshoot how to get back to a good state on your PC. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We also want to take this opportunity to recognize Insiders for their contribution in the prior April 2016 Windows&nbsp;10 Anniversary Update&nbsp;Bug Bash. For this you will see badges in Feedback Hub light up for recognizing your participation in the Bug Bash. We will be giving out another set of June Bug Bash participation badge as well post the June Bug Bash conclusion.</p>

<p>We have lots of opportunities for Windows Insiders to participate in this Windows 10 Anniversary Update Bug Bash.

  </li>

  <li>Provide feedback items one item at a time

      <li>&nbsp;When sharing feedback, logs may be collected depending on the type of feedback being submitted and system settings. Providing one at a time ensures the correct information is received </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
