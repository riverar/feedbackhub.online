<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>We are releasing a new Windows 10 Insider Preview building to the Fast ring today: <strong>Build 10532</strong>. As always, there are bug fixes and improvements in this build over 10525, but also some new features we are very excited to share with Insiders.</p>

<h4>Improved Context Menus</h4>

<p>We’ve heard feedback about the consistency of menus within Windows 10, so we’ve made some changes to improve these and give them a modern look at and feel. We are still working on it, but you’ll see some good changes with this build. We’re also further unifying the light and dark theming across the OS and are looking forward to you trying these latest changes and providing additional <a href="windows-feedback:?contextid=114">feedback</a>.</p>

<h4>Sharing Windows Feedback</h4>

<p>The Windows Feedback app will now allow you to easily share your feedback with others.</p>

<p>You have the option to share using any application that supports the Windows Share functionality or get a direct link copied to your clipboard for pasting anywhere you like. We think this will help Insiders more easily share specific feedback and suggestions with other Insiders on Twitter, Insider forum discussions, and directly with our engineers. Naturally we would like to hear your feedback on this new feature as you use it.</p>

<p>And of course, since the Windows Feedback app is a Universal Windows Platform app, it means the next mobile flight will include the ability to share feedback as well. Here is a sneak peek of what that will look like:</p>

<p>I know many of you are eagerly awaiting a new mobile build. We have found and fixed a few issues that would be a blocker for some Insiders in recent builds in our internal rings, so we haven’t had one we felt was ready to go out to you since <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/08/12/announcing-windows-10-mobile-insider-preview-build10512/">10512</a>. We have some good candidates coming through with those fixes, so after we run them for a while and ensure they are ready for you we’ll get them out. Stay tuned to the Windows Blog or <a href="http://twitter.com/gabeaul">follow me on Twitter</a> for an announcement when we have one.</p>

<p>Also with this build, language packs are available for our <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-faq">supported languages in the Windows Insider program</a>.</p>

<h4>Keep an eye out on the Insider Hub</h4>

<p>We have some upcoming feature announcements for both PC and mobile that Insiders will get to try out first. Stay tuned for more details soon.</p>

<h4>Known Issues</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Windows Hello face sign-on will not work on this build with some devices; the device can still be unlocked with other methods like pin, password, or fingerprint. </li>

  <li>As reported by Insiders on the build 10525, 64 bit Google Chrome will crash on launch. <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=522201#c36">Google is aware of the issue.</a> In the meantime their 64 bit Google Chrome Canary build or 32 bit Google Chrome will work on this build. </li>
</ul>

<p>I hope you enjoy the new build, and please keep sending us feedback on your experience via the Windows Feedback app.</p>

<p>Thanks, 
  <br />g</p>
