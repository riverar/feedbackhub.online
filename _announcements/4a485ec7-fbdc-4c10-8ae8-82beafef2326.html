<p>UPDATE 3/30: Today we are releasing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14295 for both PC and Mobile to Windows Insiders in the Slow ring. The ISO images for the build as well as the new developer tools announced today at Build 2016 will be released shortly and <a href="https://insider.windows.com/Home/Index">available here</a>. </p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>Today we are releasing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14295 for both PC and Mobile to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring.</p>

<p>In addition to devices that shipped with Windows 10 such as the Lumia 550, 650, 950, 950 XL, Xiaomi Mi4, and Alcatel OneTouch Fierce XL, we are releasing this build to the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-supported-phones">list of devices that will be capable of receiving updates as part of the Windows Insider Program</a> except the Lumia 635. We will add the Lumia 635 at a later date. Going forward – these devices will be able to receive new builds from our Development Branch that we release to the Fast and Slow rings. As we stated previously, only devices which are eligible to receive the Windows 10 Mobile upgrade will be able to get preview builds from the Development Branch.</p>

<p>With this build being only a few days newer than <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/03/17/announcing-windows-10-mobile-insider-preview-build-14291-for-pc-and-mobile/">the last build</a>, you won’t see any major new features. However, we do have a good set of fixes in this build that Insiders will enjoy.</p>

<h4><strong>Here’s what’s fixed for PC</strong></h4>

<ul>
  <li>We fixed the issue that was causing PCs to freeze when plugging in an Xbox One or Xbox 360 controller and other gamepads. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where Microsoft Edge would refresh the tab if you pressed caps lock in a password field. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue preventing the Xbox app and other Xbox Live enabled apps and games from signing in. </li>

  <li>We have fixed the driver bug that prevents Kaspersky Anti-Virus, Internet Security, or the Kaspersky Total Security Suite installed from working as expected in builds from the Development Branch. </li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Here’s what’s fixed for Mobile</strong></h4>

<ul>
  <li>We fixed the issue where If you reset your phone on Build 14291 and restore your phone from a backup, restore will fail to install apps from your backup’s apps list leaving blank grey titles on Start. You should be able to reset your phone on this build, do a restore from a backup, and have your apps installed and restored appropriately. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where new languages and keyboards were not downloading. However, there is an issue where the “reboot” UX doesn’t appear in the Settings app after downloading a new language or keyboard. You will need to go to Update &amp; security &gt; Phone update and restart your phone manually from there for the new language and keyboard to go into effect. </li>
</ul>

<h4>As always – thank you for being Windows Insiders and make sure to send us feedback on any issues you run into with these builds in the <a href="http://aka.ms/windowsfeedbackapp">Feedback Hub</a>.</h4>

<p>Thanks, 
  <br />g</p>
