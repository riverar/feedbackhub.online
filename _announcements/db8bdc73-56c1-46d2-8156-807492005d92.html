<p><b>Known issues for PC</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Feedback Hub is not localized and the UI will be in English (U.S.) only, even with language packs installed. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Feedback Hub takes about 20-30 minutes after updating to this build to download and populate itself if launched from Start. If you launch Feedback Hub from All apps – it will force the app to hydrate. </li>

  <li>Symantec products such as Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security are causing PCs to bluescreen (bug check). </li>

  <li>The QQ app from Tencent crashes. We’re working on a fix for the issue. </li>

  <li>If you are using a non-English keyboard, you can’t accept Bash prompts. </li>

  <li>We are investigating an issue where if you’re running Insider Preview builds in certain languages, the All apps list on Start appears empty. A workaround for this is to use search to launch apps. </li>

  <li>We have reduced the number of instances where boxes are seen when entering emoji. You may still see them in some text fields – we’re working on it! </li>
</ul>
