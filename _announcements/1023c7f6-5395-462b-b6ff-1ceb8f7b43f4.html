<p><font size="2">For Windows Insiders in the Fast ring, we are rolling out an update to the Windows Store that brings some improvements designed to make the install experience smoother - especially for large PC games. </font></p>

<h4><font style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold" size="2">New pick a drive experience for large PC games</font></h4>

<p><font size="2">For large games the store now allows the customer to pick their desired drive for download and install putting the customer in the driverâ€™s seat. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">If a certain app/ game does not fit on the default drive, the store pre-emptively asks the customer to pick a different drive. This prevents users from getting in an error state.</font> </p>

<p><font style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold" size="2">New Install control </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The install experience has been improved. Customers now see the exact progress of their install and the install control button changes shade. </font></p>
