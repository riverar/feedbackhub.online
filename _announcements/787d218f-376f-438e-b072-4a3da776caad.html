<p>Hi everyone, This is Mike Fortin, the Corporate VP of Windows and Devices Core Quality.&nbsp; We are excited to include you, the Windows Insiders, in this Windows 10 Anniversary Update Bug Bash. Internally we started the Bug Bash on Monday, while we validated this latest build met the ring promotion criteria. This week our teams are focused on filing feedback submissions &amp; up-votes alongside Windows Insiders, reviewing incoming feedback from Windows Insiders and Microsoft engineers, prioritizing the problems being reported from feedback, and then fixing bugs based on your feedback. The Bug Bash will run through Sunday May 1<sup>st</sup>, 11:59 PM PST. </p>

<p>We know Windows Insiders have already submitted feedback in many areas. This week is a great opportunity try new features of the product and discover areas of the product you may not have explored previously. As you do this, please submit feedback or add additional comments to any existing feedback, and up-vote problems you are also experiencing.</p>

<p>We are also using a daily set of new Quests within the Feedback hub both with our internal Microsoft engineers and Windows Insiders to help highlight different areas of the product to try and give feedback on. Today’s Quests are <a href="http://aka.ms/WIPBBQuest0">available here</a>.</p>

<p>We have lots of opportunities for Windows Insiders to participate in this Windows 10 Anniversary Update Bug Bash.</p>

<p>Feedback is important for making changes and improvements in Windows 10. This communication with users helps Microsoft gauge product satisfaction, build quality, and is instrumental in guiding conversations regarding what changes to make within the OS.</p>

<p>Check for existing feedback</p>

<ul>
  <li>Another user may have already shared the same feedback. If they have, please “upvote” the existing feedback to help prevent duplicate submissions </li>

<p>Use a clear title when submitting new feedback </p>

<ul>
  <li>Example of a good title: “Groove crashes with error 80041007 when connected to Bluetooth” </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;Provide feedback items one item at a time</p>

  <li>When sharing feedback, logs may be collected depending on the type of feedback being submitted and system settings. Providing one at a time ensures the correct information is received </li>
</ul>

<p>Provide a clear and thorough description of the issue</p>

<ul>
