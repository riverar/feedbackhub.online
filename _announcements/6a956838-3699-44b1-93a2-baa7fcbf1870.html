<p>Movies &amp; TV: 10.16092.1022 for PC and&nbsp;Mobile</p>

<p>Applicable Ring:&nbsp;<strong>Fast</strong> Ring Store update</p>

<p>Hello, Movies &amp; TV Insiders! </p>

<p>Another update for the universal Movies &amp; TV app. Check it out and let us know what you think. </p>

<p>Here’s what’s included in this update:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can purchase the next episode in the TV series you're watching without leaving the app. </li>

  <li>Accessing TV episode summaries is now just one click instead of two. </li>

  <li>Your large movies and TV galleries are no longer grouped alphabetically. </li>

  <li>Sign in will work more reliability because we changed the way we check your region. </li>

  <li>The audio track and subtitle choices are now in a single control making it easier to see your options. </li>

  <li>When using the Movies &amp; TV app on the console and sign in fails, you'll be notified so that can fix the issue. </li>

  <li>When playback fails, the app will retry more often to keep the video going. </li>

  <li>We updated the way we create version numbers so that it’s easier for us to tell when a version was produced just by looking at the version number – this one was built in the second half of September 2016 so 16092. </li>
</ul>

<p>One extra note - we accidentally included a string in the What’s New pop up related to being able to re-rent expired rentals. That change isn’t coming until a future update. Apologies for any confusion. Consider it a sneak peek! </p>

<p>Thanks for your ongoing support. We look forward to reading your feedback! </p>

<p>The Movies &amp; TV Team</p>
