<p>Hi everyone,&nbsp; </p>

<p>We have another Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview Build 10586 which we’re releasing today to Windows Insiders in the Fast and Slow ring.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This build continues to address feedback we’ve received from Windows Insiders as well as customers using our brand new Windows 10 phones like the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL. As with the previous release, this Cumulative Update continues to use the minor version for differentiating between each version - so this build will appear as 10586.36.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Windows Insiders have provided great feedback on the upgrade experience from Windows Phone 8.1. We continue to use the feedback we get from Windows Insiders to improve the upgrade experience and this update has some improvements to that experience.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Going forward, we won’t be publishing blog posts to announce new Cumulative Updates for Windows Insiders to test. Instead, we’ll publish these announcements in the Insider Hub so please check there for news. If you follow me on Twitter I’ll keep sharing news there as well. </p>

<h3>Flighting over the holidays </h3>

<p>I also want to set expectations for new builds for both PC and mobile between now and the end of 2015. This time of year many of us take the opportunity to spend time with family and take some vacation time, so the engineering team will be running at a slower pace and many of our key people who drive our flighting process will be out (including me) This means we won’t be releasing any new builds to Windows Insiders until January, for both PC and mobile.&nbsp; Please keep sending us feedback using the Windows Feedback app. </p>

<p>Thanks, </p>

<p>g </p>
