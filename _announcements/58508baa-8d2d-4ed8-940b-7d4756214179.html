<p>We have a few known issues for Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 11082</p>

<ul>
  <li>Languages packages and Features on Demand will fail to install on this build. We are investigating workarounds. </li>

  <li>When copying, deleting, or moving files there will be no progress dialog shown. The file action will complete without intervention. This can cause confusion when acting on large files or directories. </li>

  <li>With this build, application defaults for some applications will be reset. Music &amp; Video will default to Windows Media Player. This can be reconfigured opening Cortana or Search and searching for “Choose default apps by file type” to open the correct settings page. </li>
</ul>
