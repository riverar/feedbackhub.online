<p>After the problem two weeks ago, we’re excited today to re-release linked inboxes, select all, mobile month view, and some other top requested features. We are listening to what you tell us, and are working hard to give you the best experience possible. Today’s release is just to mobile Insiders to keep the audience small and to make sure everything is working great. Insiders, please give feedback through Feedback app for <a href="windows-feedback:?contextid=136">Mail</a> and <a href="windows-feedback:?contextid=442">Calendar</a> issues that you might experience. Thank you!</p>
