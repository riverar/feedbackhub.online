<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>Today we are releasing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14316 to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring.</p>

<p>At Build 2016 last week, we shared <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/03/30/windows-10-anniversary-update-brings-new-experiences-and-developer-opportunity/">new experiences and new opportunities we’re creating for developers with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update</a> which we will be releasing for free to all Windows 10 customers this summer. Windows 10 is the fastest growing Windows ever with over 270 million active devices currently, and Windows Insiders are the first to try out new innovations coming in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update by installing builds from our Development Branch. A few weeks ago, Insiders were the first to try out extensions for Microsoft Edge. With today’s build, we have even more new features for Insiders to try and we will continue to deliver new features such as Windows Ink in future builds. So give this build a try and let us know what you think.</p>

<h4>Here’s what’s new in Build 14316</h4>

<p><strong>Run native Bash on Ubuntu on Windows:</strong> In this build, you can natively run Bash in Windows as announced last week at Build 2016. To do this, you first need to turn on Developer Mode via Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; For developers. Then search for “Windows Features” and choose “Turn Windows features on or off” and enable Windows Subsystem for Linux (Beta). To get Bash installed, open Command Prompt and type “bash”. For more details, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/03/30/run-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows/">see this blog post</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cortana Cross-Device Features:</strong> Starting today, we will be releasing new features to Insiders on an ongoing basis that keeps you in perfect sync across all the devices where you use Cortana to stay connected and never miss a beat throughout your day. With today’s build, we are rolling out the below features.&nbsp; If you are an Insider who doesn’t have a Windows phone, these features will also work with Android devices too but you will need Cortana Version 1.5 or higher (Download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.cortana">here</a>&nbsp;for U.S. and download <a href="http://www.msxiaona.cn/">here</a> for China) for them to work.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Low Battery Notifications:</strong> Cortana will now inform you of low battery power on your mobile devices. For example, if your phone’s battery is low, a notification will pop up on your PC so you can promptly charge it before your next meeting. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=99aPUSJkYL0" target="_blank">Link to video.</a> </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Find my phone/Ring my phone:</strong> We all lose track of our phone from time to time and now you can ask Cortana to find your phone, regardless of device, on your PC using the new find my phone feature. The feature will allow users to locate their phone from their PC through geo-location and by having Cortana ring your phone. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=bOGLBu4_cyY" target="_blank">Link to video.</a> </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Share map directions across devices:</strong> To date, people go through a lot of effort to manually connect the dots between devices—emailing links to open on other devices or re-doing a search on the phone to find directions to a location they were just looking at on the PC. Today, we’re breaking down one of those barriers by enabling you to access navigation details across devices through Cortana. Tell Cortana “directions to &lt; place&gt;” on your PC and she’ll send those same directions to your phone. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=zbZ1xS1Kc6o" target="_blank">Link to video</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Making Cortana easier to setup on your device:</strong> If you are in Cortana supported markets and struggled to get Cortana enabled, this will automatically download the necessary speech language, if needed, and enable Cortana for you.</p>

<p><strong>New and Updates Extensions for Microsoft Edge:</strong> A few weeks ago, we announced the availability of extension support for Microsoft Edge with more on the way. Today, we are excited to share with you some new extensions that you can try out – Pin It Button and OneNote Clipper. In addition, we have updated versions of Reddit Enhancement Suite, Mouse Gestures, and Microsoft Translator. To install these new extensions, just click on “More” (…) at the top right in Microsoft Edge and click “Extensions” to open the Extensions pane and click “Get extensions”.</p>

<p><img src="http://compass.microsoft.com/assets/bb/0f/bb0fae4e-f53a-4781-a04c-94ae01b2158e.png?n=14361new-edge-extensions.png" width="596" height="244" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Please note: There is change in this build that will break existing extensions installed on your PC in Microsoft Edge if they were previously installed using an older build. You can download the new installation files and re-install the existing extensions using the new installers.</em></p>

<p><strong>Try out the Skype UWP Preview app:</strong> You can try out the Skype UWP Preview app announced a couple of weeks ago on the <a href="http://blogs.skype.com/2016/03/24/skype-universal-windows-platform-app-preview-for-windows-10-is-coming-to-windows-insiders/">Skype blog</a>. The Skype UWP Preview app includes a lot of the basic Skype functionality – with more features and functionality to come in the next couple of releases. We are first releasing this for PCs only, but we will be making the Skype UWP app available on for Mobile in a future build.</p>

<p><strong>Action Center Improvements:</strong> We have added the ability to select which app notifications are more important to you in Action Center. On your device, you can manage the notification settings for individual apps by going to Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications &amp; actions. Just click or tap on a specific app to adjust its notification settings. You can prioritize its notifications in Action Center to be one of 3 levels: Normal, High, or Priority. Additionally, you can also adjust how many notifications are visible per app. The default is now 3 per app. If an app has more than 3 notifications, just click or tap to expand and see all notifications for that app. This was a top request from Insiders.</p>

<p><strong>Updated Emoji:</strong> We wanted to share some cool work from our design team that is showing up in this build. We are updating the entire set of font-based emoji in Windows 10 that aligns with the Microsoft Design Language with a distinct visual style as well as the Unicode standard.</p>

<p><img alt="New Microsoft Emoji" src="http://az648995.vo.msecnd.net/win/2016/04/MICROSOFT-EMOJI-V3.gif" width="320" height="320" /></p>

<p>These new emoji are designed to be detailed, expressive, and playful. Their larger size takes full advantage of every pixel and the two-pixel outline allows for emoji to appear on any color background without loss of fidelity.</p>

<p><img src="http://compass.microsoft.com/assets/54/a4/54a47136-de70-4417-8cc3-f21162709149.png?n=14361EMOJI-HIGHLIGHTS-v2_Page_02-2-1024x913.png" width="675" height="602" /></p>

<p>Our new emoji also supports skin tone modification across a wide variety of people glyphs.</p>

<p><strong>Personalization Improvements:</strong> We’ve added the ability to universally toggle between dark and light modes via Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors.</p>

<p><img src="http://compass.microsoft.com/assets/20/b0/20b0c84f-1898-4c3c-a824-06a7519596dd.png?n=14361dark-mode-1024x640.png" /></p>

<p>When you switch to dark mode, apps such as Settings, Store, Alarms &amp; Clock, Calculator and other UWP apps that listen and respond to theme changes in the OS will change into dark mode. Some UWP apps that control their own theme settings (separate from Windows) won’t change by toggling this setting.</p>

<p><img src="http://compass.microsoft.com/assets/95/70/957048b9-0d49-4264-a71c-c726e7e1cfa3.png?n=14631personalization-updates-colors-1024x741.png" /></p>

<p>We’ve also added a new option under Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors to show color only on app title bars in addition to the option to show color on Start, the taskbar, and Action Center.</p>

<p><strong>New PC access experience:</strong> Using the new Connect app, you can bring the Continuum experience from your phone (a Continuum-enabled Windows 10 phone is required) to the PC without needing a dock or Miracast adapter. Additionally, it also allows other Miracast-enabled PCs to project to other PCs without needing a dock or Miracast adapter as well. The Connect app will mention the ability to use a USB cable to connect to your PC however this is a bug and the app only supports wireless connections on PCs. This is an early preview of this feature – we have more work coming to make the experience even better.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Virtual Desktop Improvements:</strong> You can now pin a window so it’s available on every desktop. To do this, launch Task View then right-click on the window you want to pin and choose “Show this window on all desktops”. Try pinning Skype or Groove Music so they’re always at your fingertips. And if you have a multi-mon setup, you might enjoy the ability to have your email app on the second monitor no matter which desktop you switch to.</p>

<p><img src="http://compass.microsoft.com/assets/33/24/3324af53-a0f0-4b56-879b-4ec2fffa9291.png?n=14361vd-show-all-desktops-1024x640.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>New Update Progress Experience:</strong> When you PC installs today’s new build update – you will see a new progress experience for installing the update. This is part of an effort to align the experience of installing updates from Windows Update.</p>

<p><img src="http://compass.microsoft.com/assets/70/a3/70a3ae3c-ac2b-4fe2-b080-b11789fd2f20.png?n=NewUpgradeExperience.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Updated Battery Settings and Battery Saving Experience</strong><strong>: </strong>We have renamed “Battery Saver” settings page to be “Battery” since we believe a single entry point for all battery related settings including Battery Saver simplifies the user experience.</p>

<p><img src="http://compass.microsoft.com/assets/00/f7/00f77e49-b5c7-46d9-aa09-220691b9d430.png?n=14361battery-savings-1024x741.png" width="704" height="509" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also updated the Detailed Battery Use page so you can now manage the per-app background settings inline without going to a second page and added a new background settings option called “Managed by Windows”.</p>

<p><img src="http://compass.microsoft.com/assets/e7/d0/e7d0654c-cf58-4f0a-9d2b-70707008f952.png?n=14361battery-details.png" width="548" height="240" /></p>

<p>With this option, not only will the app stop running in the background when Battery Saver is enabled, but it will temporarily turn off apps with high battery drain that you haven’t used in a while or pinned to your Start screen till you next launch the application (shown as “Turned off by system” on the Detailed Battery Use page). We also added a prompt asking the user if they’d like to turn on Battery Saver when battery is at 20% – something we had with Windows Phone 8.1 that Insiders wanted to see us re-implement as we merged Battery Sense into the Settings app for both PC and mobile.</p>

<p><strong>Updated Windows Update Settings:</strong> You can now set the time in which you are most active on your device by adjusting active hours under Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update. Windows Update will avoid automatically installing updates during your active hours on your device.</p>

<p><strong>Commenting in the Feedback Hub:</strong> As we announced at Build last week, we have added the ability to comment on feedback inside the Feedback Hub. You have seen responses from our engineering team in the app already, in what we call “sticky comments”. Those comments are now the top items in a comments thread where you can discuss feedback with each other and us. So in addition to up-voting on feedback, you can now comment on feedback too. We hope you will use the discussion feature to share workarounds, discuss suggestions others have made, and share any new info you have about problems you’re seeing. As always, please let us know what you think by going to <a href="http://aka.ms/Azb9q6">Apps &amp; Games &gt; Feedback Hub</a> and joining the discussion!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Messaging Everywhere Preview Coming Soon:</strong> We will soon be enabling a preview of the “Messaging everywhere” feature in Windows 10 that allows you to send and receive text messages from your phone directly from your Windows 10 PC’s. You will see options for this feature in the Messaging app on PC however an update is required for the Messaging app for Mobile for this experience to work. More to come on this when the experience is live.</p>

<h4><strong>Here’s what’s fixed for PC</strong></h4>

<ul>
  <li>We fixed the issue where on some PCs with TPM chips, such as the ASUS Zenbook UX31, you may have experienced glitchy audio and jumpy movement when using the trackpad due to the “tpm-maintenance” task running constantly in the background instead of once per boot-up like it should. </li>

  <li>We fixed the issue where if you use Hyper-V and have a Virtual Switch configured for your network adapter, you might see an error indicator (red-colored “X”) for your network adapter in the notification area of your taskbar. </li>

  <li>We polished the Wi-Fi flyout UI and fixed an issue where text entry into a Wi-Fi password field was noticeably top-aligned rather than centered. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue for where when using multiple monitors and full-screen apps like PowerPoint or Remote Desktop would crash Windows Explorer. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where Cortana wasn’t showing Settings pages in the search results. </li>

  <li>We have updated the Windows Update notification after updates have been installed so now clicking on the notification will take you straight to your update history. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where desktop (Win32) apps pinned to the Start menu would sometimes move after updating to a new build. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where “Update and Restart” and “Update and Shut Down” wouldn’t start an update. </li>
</ul>

<h4>As always – thank you for being Windows Insiders and make sure to send us feedback on any issues you run into with these builds in the <a href="http://aka.ms/windowsfeedbackapp">Feedback Hub</a>.</h4>

<p>Thanks,
