<p><b>Bring ‘The Martian’ to Earth with Hacking Mars design challenge</b></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft is excited to partner with ‘20<sup>th</sup> Century Fox on an epic partnership for film, ‘The Martin’.&nbsp; For the design challenge anyone (18+ worldwide) is asked from cross-discipline teams and design innovative solutions to hack Mars to help a stranded astronaut.&nbsp; The winning team will receive $25k and a trip to Microsoft to experience Mars via HoloLens in addition to a workshop to help shape their idea, and tools to help them make it a reality- Microsoft Surface, Xbox One, and Microsoft Band.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.hackingmars.com/">Hacking Mars Design Challenge</a> invites teams to research and submit a three-to-five minute video about a product, service, app or&nbsp;game that would help the stranded astronaut: stay alive (grow food, filter air, produce water), pass time (keeping hope alive, dealing with extreme isolation and constant stress) and get home (focusing on communication issues). They can tackle one topic or take on all three. The deadline for entries is Oct. 13.</p>

  <p>You can learn more about the challenge <a href="http://news.microsoft.com/features/microsoft-brings-the-martian-to-earth-with-hacking-mars-design-challenge-bing-watney-home-map-experience-and-more/">here</a>. </p>
