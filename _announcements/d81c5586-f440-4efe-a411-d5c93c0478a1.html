<ul>
  <li>You won’t be able to deploy an app via Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 to a phone running this build. As a workaround – you can deploy the app by using the Windows 10 Application Deployment (WinAppDeployCmd.exe) command-line tool. </li>

  <li>In some cases, the new cross-device Cortana features <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/06/01/announcing-windows-10-mobile-insider-preview-build-14356/">first highlighted in Build 14356</a> may not work. Restarting your phone should fix the issue and get the features working. </li>

  <li>After installing this build, you may notice your Quick Actions icons are not in the same order.&nbsp;This is a side effect of the fixes/changes we made to Action Center. To re-arrange your icons to your preferred order, just go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications &amp; actions &gt; (Quick actions) and touch, hold, and then drag to re-arrange icons to whatever position you want. Remember: the four items in the top row are what will show as your immediately viewable Quick Actions. </li>

  <li>We are continuing to investigate data issues with some Dual-SIM devices where cellular data doesn’t work correctly with a second SIM. Several issues relating to cellular data with Dual-SIM devices have been reported by Insiders with the last two Mobile builds and we’re investigating these reports.
