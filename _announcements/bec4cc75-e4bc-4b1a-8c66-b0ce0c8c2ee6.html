<p>Hey Windows Insiders!</p>

<p>First off – I want to say that you were <em>amazing</em> during last week’s Bug Bash. You completed ~71K Quests and filed 81,217 pieces of feedback and up-votes. Windows Insiders from all over the world participated including strong participation from China, India, and Brazil which gave us great insight into what we can expect in our international markets. We even saw feedback from Insiders in far-away places like Botswana, Turkmenistan, Gambia, Seychelles, Togo, Mali, Liberia, or Greenland. Together, we are making a product that people will love all over the world. THANK YOU!</p>

<p>With your help, we’re on our way to make the Windows 10 Anniversary Update awesome for ALL of our customers this summer. The team is busily working on triaging and investigating the top bugs that you sent in. The hustle is pretty real around Redmond right now. As they check in fixes for these bugs into builds, its important for us to get those builds out to you as soon as we can to validate those fixes. So here we are today with another new build for you! We are releasing Build 14372 for both PC and Mobile to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring.</p>

<p>This build is just one build newer than the last one but has a handful of fixes to improvement overall performance and reliability.</p>
