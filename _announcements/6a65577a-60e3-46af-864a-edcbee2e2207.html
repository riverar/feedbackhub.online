<p>Hello my Windows Insiders! </p>

<p>I'm at the Worldwide Partner Conference (WPC) this week to meet partners and customers to understand the needs of their businesses and brands. Yesterday I gave a talk about what I have learned about my first 41 days about being the Insider lead and what I envision for the future of the program. Nothing should be a surprise for you, my Insiders. We are all about education and empowerment to transform every industry with our tech skills in the next decade. The audience had quite a few questions about how to engage their own customers in different industries (autos, medical, construction) and I learned quite a bit about how these industries differ from tech. It got me thinking about how to help these leaders build fans-as-part-of-product programs like ours. You can find the audio and slides from the talk here.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>In build news, today we are releasing Build 14388 for both PC and Mobile to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring. This build has 44 new fixes in it including a bunch of fixes to improvement reliability and battery life and improvements to accessibility. A few of the most notable fixes are listed below.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>Improvements and fixes for PC </h3>

<ul>
  <li>We have updated the Store to version 11606.1001.39 with bug fixes.&nbsp; </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where Narrator keyboard shortcuts would not work after locking your PC and then logging back in and going to your desktop.&nbsp; </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where Narrator would not read the date and time under Settings &gt; Time &amp; language &gt; Date &amp; time. </li>

  <li>We fixed a TPM driver crash that could result in the device bug-checking (bluescreen) and rebooting. </li>
</ul>

<p>We're getting down to the wire, my Insiders. Thank you for your dedication this past weekend and every day.&nbsp; </p>
