<p><strong>Sticky Notes App</strong>:&nbsp;Version 1.1.40 </p>

<p>Applicable Rings: <strong>Fast</strong> Store update</p>

<ul>
  <li>Performance&nbsp;improvements: Opening the app and deleting notes are faster than ever before. </li>

  <li>Fixed: Rapidly toggling of the "Don't Ask Me Again" checkbox when deleting a note which would cause your selection to be ignored and default to never asking you again. </li>

  <li>Fixed: Stock Prices could, on occasion, include only three significant figures. This is one too few, so they now always include four. </li>
</ul>
