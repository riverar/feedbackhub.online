<p>The Windows Store for Business will be the storefront for organizational decision-makers to find and acquire Windows Store apps in volume, control private line-of-business apps, as well as to manage and distribute these apps directly to employees who use Windows 10 devices. Flexible app distribution via built-in store methods or integration with management tools will be available.</p>

<p>Windows Store for Business planned availability for organizations is later this year.
