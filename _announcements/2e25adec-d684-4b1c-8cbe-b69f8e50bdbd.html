<h3><strong>Known issues for PC</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>While using Narrator and Groove Music, if you navigate to the progress bar while a song is playing then Narrator will continually speak the progress of the song e.g. update with the current time of the progress bar every second. The result is you will be unable to listen to the song or hear any other control you navigate to. </li>

  <li>You may experience a black screen when signing out and switching to another user account and will be unable to log in to that account. A reboot of your PC should allow you to log in to that account. </li>

  <li>Oracle VM VirtualBox will crash on launch after upgrading to this build. </li>

  <li>Optional components may not work after upgrading to this build. To get it working again, go to “Turn Windows features on or off”, scroll down and check the right optional component and click ok.&nbsp; After a reboot, the optional component will be enabled again. </li>

  <li>After updating to this build, Windows Calculator may not work. To get Calculator working again, go to the Store and re-download/install Calculator. </li>

  <li>For keyboard users, using tab to navigate the Settings app will not work in this build. The arrow keys should work as a temporary workaround</li>
</ul>
