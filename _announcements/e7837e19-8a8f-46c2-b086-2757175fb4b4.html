<p><b>Known issues for PC</b></p>

<ul>
  <li><s>While using Narrator and Groove Music, if you navigate to the progress bar while a song is playing then Narrator will continually speak the progress of the song e.g. update with the current time of the progress bar every second. The result is you will be unable to listen to the song or hear any other control you navigate to.</s></li>

  <li>Oracle VM VirtualBox will crash on launch after upgrading to this build.</li>

  <li>Optional components may not work after upgrading to this build. To get it working again, go to “Turn Windows features on or off”, scroll down and check the right optional component and click ok.&nbsp; After a reboot, the optional component will be enabled again.</li>

  <li><s>For keyboard users, using tab to navigate the Settings app will not work in this build. The arrow keys should work as a temporary workaround.</s></li>

  <li>Tencent apps and games will cause your PC to bugcheck (bluescreen).</li>
