<p>Today we are launching firmware updates for a few Windows 10 Mobile devices. The Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL will receive this firmware revision [1078.38.16025] in select markets. To receive this update today, Insiders will need to switch to the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/windows-10-mobile-firmware-updates/48bea9be-8082-47ec-904d-cc60037461a7">Production ring</a> and check for updates. Windows Insiders that donâ€™t move to the Production ring will receive these updates in early March as we synchronize Insider ring and Current Branch firmware publishing.</p>

<p>Key improvements include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stability fixes. </li>

  <li>Improvements for GPS reliability. </li>

  <li>Improvements for call audio quality. </li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the LG Lancet (VW820) on Verizon and the Lumia 830 on AT&amp;T, both in the US, will receive firmware updates. These new firmware version numbers are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>LG Lancet [820.10300.11.101]</li>

  <li>Lumia 830 [2179.0.15455.24047]</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to device targeting restrictions, these updates are only available to devices running Windows Phone 8.1. Windows Insiders that would like this firmware immediately will need to recover to 8.1 using the <a href="file:///C:/Users/tjr/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/DRX1JV4P/aka.ms/wdrt">Windows Device Recovery Tool</a>, install the new firmware, and then update to Windows 10 Mobile once again.</p>
