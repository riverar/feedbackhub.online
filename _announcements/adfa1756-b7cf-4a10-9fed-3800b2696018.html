<p>Hello my Windows Insiders!</p>

<p>Since you all seemed to like the breakneck build pace last week, we’re starting the week off right and releasing not one, not two, not three…but *four* builds today. Today we are releasing Build 14376 for both PC and Mobile to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring. The late nights continue in Redmond and this build has nearly 1,800 fixes over <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/06/23/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14372-for-pc-and-mobile/">the last build</a> – with many of the notable fixes and improvements listed below.</p>

<p>For Windows Insiders in the Slow ring, we are releasing <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/06/23/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14372-for-pc-and-mobile/">Build 14372 for PC and Mobile</a> to you today as well.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT: Today, we are pushing a few builds out to into our internal rings in addition to today’s Fast and Slow builds and as a result of that, the builds for PC for the Fast and Slow rings is a little bit behind in rolling out and should be available in the next few hours depending on your region. </strong></p>

<h3>Improvements and fixes for PC</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We’re rolling out an Store update (11606.1001.25) that improves performance and reliability and includes fixes for accessibility as well. </li>

  <li>Clicking on networks or VPN connections in the network flyout on the taskbar should now launch the network settings page like it should. We also fixed an issue where the network flyout would sometimes only show the network settings link, despite being currently connected to Wi-Fi. </li>

  <li>For my dev peeps: we fixed the issue causing an error message when you enable Developer Mode due to the necessary package needed from Windows Update not being published appropriately. Go forth and create! </li>

  <li>We have updated Narrator to now support using physical volume buttons to adjust the volume while Narrator is in Scan Mode. We also fixed an issue that could result in Narrator crashing when arrowing through list entries. </li>

  <li>We have updated Windows Hello on the Lock screen to not repeat the name of the person logging in, when it is already displayed on the screen. </li>

  <li>We have fixed an issue where you might be unable to type in some UWP apps. We also fixed an issue resulting in certain Polish characters being duplicated when typed into UWP apps. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where the Lock screen background might not be displayed correctly. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where your password would revert be being hidden if you tried to edit it while holding the reveal button. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where the search dropdown in the Settings app could end up displaying above the search box instead of below it. We also fixed an issue where the “For developers” settings page would be blank while checking for an optional package, and an issue resulting in no handwriting, speech and other optional components being listed for languages that do support them. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue that could result in not being able to turn on “set time zone automatically”. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where the icons in some Start menu tiles could appear zoomed in, for example Alarms &amp; Clock app or Calculator app. </li>

  <li>We have improved the consistency in scrolling and zooming speeds between monitors when using a precision touchpad on a multiple-monitor setup. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue that could result in Explorer.exe crashing after receiving a notification from Microsoft Edge. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where the caret might jump to the beginning of the line, rather than maintaining current y axis position when using the up and down arrow keys in a textbox in Microsoft Edge. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue resulting in an authentication error when launching mstsc.exe from an elevated Command Prompt. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements and fixes for Mobile</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We’re rolling out an Store update (11606.1001.25) that improves performance and reliability and includes fixes for accessibility as well. </li>

  <li>The Gadgets app has been updated to fix issues using it with a Microsoft Display Dock. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue that could result in tiles pinned to Start from within an app being blank after a restore. We also fixed an issue that could result in multiple Live tiles no longer updating until the phone had been rebooted. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue making it difficult to download certain offline maps via Settings &gt; System &gt; Offline maps, as the list would jump back to the top when you reached close to the bottom. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue resulting in the Camera app intermittently freezing for a second when used in certain apps. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue resulting in links no longer working in Microsoft Edge after exiting one-handed mode while a webpage is loading. We also fixed an issue where the enter key would act as if it had been pressed twice on some websites, resulting in two new lines being entered. </li>

  <li>We have improved the reliability of going between camera roll and Camera app. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where estimated time remaining for battery life under Settings &gt; System &gt; Battery could be clipped. We also improved performance of enumerating the list of apps in under Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where the link in Cortana to download a speech language would open the Settings app homepage instead of going directly to Settings &gt; Time and language &gt; Language. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where the checkmarks in checkboxes in high contrast mode didn’t use the correct contrast ratio making them difficult to see. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Other items of note</h3>

<p>We have been testing with Windows Insiders a preview of the “Messaging everywhere” feature that allows you to receive and send text messages from your Windows 10 phone directly to and from your Windows 10 PC. The experience was well-received by Insiders however we believe we can deliver an even better experience through the Skype app. Because of this, we decided not to release this feature as part of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update this summer. Starting with Build 14376 and going forward, Insiders will no longer have the ability to reply to text messages from their phone via the Messaging app on their PCs. The ability to reply to text messages on your PC using Cortana is unaffected. Going forward, we will be working with the Skype Team on delivering a great “messaging everywhere” experience on your Windows 10 devices through the Skype app. We will share more details about this experience in the months ahead.</p>

<p>All right, that’s it (for now). Don’t get comfortable. Keep hustling, 
  <br />Dona &lt;3</p>
