<p>Director</p>

<p><strong>What is the one word that describes how you work?</strong></p>

<p>LIFO </p>

<p><strong>How many years at Microsoft?</strong> </p>

<p>Five</p>

<p><strong>Where did you grow up? </strong></p>

<p>On the East Coast of the US: Massachusetts, North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida</p>

<p><strong>Describe your role with Microsoft and the Windows Insider Program</strong></p>

<p>I work with a scrappy and passionate team of stealthy ninjacats to support our community of Insiders, co-Create Windows, and use technology to make a better world.</p>

<p><strong>What technologies do you work on?</strong> </p>

<p>We believe that people can use Windows and Microsoft technology to accomplish the important things in their lives. Whether they’re starting a business, running a design shop, or improving an NGO, technology can help them go further, faster. Some of the key technologies I use daily are: the Windows platform itself (especially command line, Multiple Desktops, Windows Hello, &amp; Cortana), Office (Word, Excel, OneNote, &amp; PowerPoint), and Azure. The main tech I help think through and evolve with our partners are the Windows Insiders for Business (WIP4Biz) infrastructure; as well as helping bring online key community tools for WIP like an improved website, discussion forums, and Feedback Hub.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite feature on Windows 10?</strong> </p>

<p>Multiple Desktops!</p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite app?</strong> </p>

<p>Outlook&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Describe one of your favorite experiences with the Insider community</strong></p>

<p>One of my favorite times with the Insider community was in Toronto at our Worldwide Partner Conference (WPC). We met a visually impaired Insider named Jason, who is a member of the Insider program to help us identify and fix problems, not only to help himself navigate life with technology, but also on behalf of the broader community of 285 million visually-impaired persons worldwide.</p>

<p><strong>Which gadget can't you live without, your PC or Phone?</strong> </p>

<p>Definitely my PC</p>

<p><strong>What is your current work setup?</strong> </p>

<p>I use a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon running Insider Fast. Since I’m frequently on the go, I use just the laptop most of the time at coffeeshops, on park benches, couches, and airplane seats; and in the back of an Uber. I also carry a Surface Pro 3 on Canary, mostly for reading and taking notes on long documents and for sketching ideas. My main phone is an HP Elite X3, running Insider Slow.</p>

<p>The handmade Chinese noodles in Café 9</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite food or restaurant? </strong></p>

<p>Señor Moose, a super-authentic Mexican restaurant (despite the name) in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. I nearly always get the Carne Asada a la Tampiqueña </p>

<p><strong>What do you do outside of work?</strong> 

  <br />I love being outdoors—running, biking, swimming; playing Ultimate Frisbee; hiking, camping, skiing, surfing. I enjoy travelling as well.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite tip for Windows?</strong></p>

<p>Windows-Ctrl-right &amp; -left arrows to change quickly between desktops</p>
