<h3><b>Known issues for PC</b></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Opening Battery settings page via Settings &gt; System &gt; Battery will crash the Settings app. </li>

  <li>The option to enable the Virtual Touchpad is missing from the taskbar context menu.</li>

  <li>Cortana's cross-device scenarios won't work on this build (including notification mirroring, missed call, share photos, share directions, low battery, and find my phone).</li>

  <li>Some websites in Microsoft Edge may unexpectedly show "We can’t reach this page". If you encounter this, please try accessing the site from an InPrivate tab.</li>

  <li>Dragging apps from the all apps list to pin on Start’s tile grid won’t work. For now, please right-click on the desired app in order to pin it.</li>

  <li>Using CTRL + C to copy in Command Prompt won't work.</li>

  <li>When projecting to a secondary monitor, if you set the connection to “Extended”, Explorer.exe may start crashing in a loop. If this happens, turn off your PC, disconnect the secondary monitor, then restart your PC. </li>

  <li>The touch keyboard button may be unexpectedly missing from the taskbar. If this happens, open the taskbar context menu, and select "Show touch keyboard button".</li>

  <li>You may see an error from Windows Hello saying "Couldn't turn on the camera" on the lock screen.</li>

  <li>Brightness changes made via Settings &gt; System &gt; Display will unexpectedly revert after closing the Settings app. For now, please use either Action Center, power flyout or brightness keys to change the brightness</li>

  <li>The list of apps in the Surface Dial “Add an app” page via Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Wheel may unexpectedly be empty. If that happens, tap the “Browse for an app” button at the bottom of the screen to pick the desired app instead.</li>

  <li>Miracast sessions will fail to connect.</li>

  <li>The Netflix app may display a black screen rather than the expected video content. As a workaround, you can use Microsoft Edge to watch video content from Netflix. </li>

  <li>On certain hardware types (e.g.: Acer Aspire), the Netflix app crashes when starting a movie.</li>

  <li>3rd party UWP apps would crash on devices if the DPI settings on the machine are &gt;=150% (Generally people do this on high resolution devices – Surface book etc.)</li>

  <li>If you upgrade from Windows 8.1 directly to Build 15002, all your store apps are lost during upgrade process but you can go and re-download all the lost apps from the Store.</li>

  <li>When using Microsoft Edge with Narrator, you may hear “no item in view" or silence while tabbing or using other navigation commands. You can use Alt + Tab when this happens to move focus away from and back to the Edge browser. Narrator will then read as expected.</li>

  <li>Saying "Hey Cortana, play &lt;item&gt; on &lt;AppName&gt;" doesn’t work immediately after installing the app. Wait 5 minutes for indexing to begin and try again. </li>
</ul>
