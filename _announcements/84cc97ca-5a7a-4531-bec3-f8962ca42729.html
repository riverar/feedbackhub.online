<h3><b>Known issues for PC</b></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Previously installed extensions for Microsoft Edge may not work for around 15 minutes after your first sign-in. A work around for this is to manually re-install each extension from the Store.</li>

  <li>In some cases, the new Cortana features highlighted above may not work. Restarting your PC should fix the issue and get the features working. </li>

  <li>Using the keyboard to navigate in certain Store apps like Netflix or Tweetium does not work. You will need to use your mouse. </li>
</ul>
