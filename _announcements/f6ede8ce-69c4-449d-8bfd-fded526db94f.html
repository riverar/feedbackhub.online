<h3>Known issues for PC</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Clicking on networks or VPN connections in the network flyout on the taskbar doesn’t launch the network settings page like it should. </li>

  <li>There are a few known issues with the Evernote Web Clipper extension for Microsoft Edge. The Evernote Web Clipper might not load on certain websites and there is no thumbnail image when clipping bookmarks. There are also various visual issues. </li>

  <li>When you enable Developer Mode in this build, you will receive an error message because the necessary package needs from Windows Update isn’t being published appropriately. This will prevent you from using Device Portal. We’re working to get this fixed as soon as possible. You can still F5 deploy apps from Visual Studio to your PC.</li>
</ul>
