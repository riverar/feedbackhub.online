<h3><b>Known issues for PC</b><b></b></h3>

<ul>
  <li>After upgrading to this build, there may be some cases in which when your PC enters Connected Standby, it may have a bluescreen (bugcheck). For more information on how to mitigate this issue if this happens to you – see this forum post. </li>

  <li>We are continuing to make changes to our extension datastore schema in Microsoft Edge. As a result, after updating to this build any extensions installed in Microsoft Edge will be removed. You can reinstall these extensions to get them back. </li>

  <li>Feedback Hub is not localized and the UI will be in English (U.S.) only, even with language packs installed. </li>

  <li>Feedback Hub takes about 20-30 minutes after updating to this build to download and hydrate itself. If Feedback Hub is not fully hydrated, if you receive a mini-survey notification it will take you nowhere in the app, search in Feedback Hub won’t show results, and if you click to go to Feedback Hub from another app or setting, Feedback will not open. </li>

  <li>The Desktop App Converter Preview (Project Centennial) will fail to run on the Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14328. If you are a developer utilizing the converter tool to convert your desktop app to UWP, we suggest skipping Build 14328 until we can fix this issue. </li>

  <li>All Tencent online games no longer work in current builds from the Development Branch. </li>

  <li>The updated UAC UI (mentioned above) breaks the ALT + Y keyboard shortcut to choose “yes”. </li>

  <li>If you are in an app and click on a link with a URL longer than 260 characters, it will bring up the “Open with…” dialog instead of opening with your default browser. </li>

  <li>We are aware of situations in which Groove Music will crash on launch at the splash screen and working to get a fix out soon. As a workaround, you can use Groove Music online. </li>

  <li>Playing music in the Groove Music within 2 minutes after logging into your PC will result in 0xc10100ae playback errors. If you wait more than 2 minutes after logging in to play music in Groove Music you will avoid this issue. </li>

  <li>In Microsoft Edge, some large downloads may appear to get stuck at 99% completion. You can work around this issue by renaming the file in your downloads after closing Microsoft Edge. This workaround skips security checks on the file, so it should be used only with files from a trusted source. </li>

  <li>If you have BitLocker/Device Encryption enabled and try go back to a previous Insider Preview build via “Go back to an earlier build” under Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery – the app will crash and you will be unable to rollback. To work around this issue, disable BitLocker/Device Encryption and try again. </li>

  <li>Settings will crash if you try to pin one of the pages to Start, resulting in page not being pinned </li>

  <li>You may see square boxes in certain apps when using some of the new emoji – we’re still getting things set up, this will be resolved in a future build. </li>

  <li>If you upgraded from 14316, you may see stuck apps in the Store. Those apps will also be duplicated in Start’s all apps list (one real, one pending). To resolve this: 1) Start downloading some other app. 2) Pause the download, then go to the downloads and update view. 3) Click the "Resume All" button. Once everything has downloaded, the issue should be resolved. </li>
</ul>
