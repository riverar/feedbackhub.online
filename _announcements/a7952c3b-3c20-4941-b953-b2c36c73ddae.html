<p>Maps App: version 5.1610.2953.0 </p>

<p>Applicable Ring: <b>Fast</b> Ring Store update</p>

<p><b>Maps lets you organize your saved places into Collections</b></p>

<p>One of our most requested features has been to be able to organize your favorites, and save places into collections. With the latest Maps update, you can do that! So go ahead and organize your favorites or start adding all the places you want to keep as a reference in separate lists—without overloading your favorites list.</p>

<p>We also made it easier to save places, as favorites or to a collection. You can now open the favorites or collections list and start adding places from there, or as before, add them from the details pane for any place. And now you can tap on your current location and save it to your favorites or a collection too.</p>

<p>Finally, we also updated how you view and save your most important favorites: home, work, and where you parked your car. They’re up at the top of your favorites list, but they take up less space and are easier to add.</p>
