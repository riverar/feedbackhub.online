<p><strong>Windows 10 Team Profile</strong> </p>

<p>To give you even more insight into Windows 10, we’d like to introduce you to some of the people on our team and how they support the platform – and Windows Insiders like you. We’ll feature team profiles on an ongoing basis here in the Hub.</p>

<p><b>Adam Avery, Software Engineer </b></p>

<p>My name is Adam Avery and I am a Software Engineer II on the Photos app team. I advocate for the product changes our users ask for by reading through the feedback we collect from the Windows Feedback app and UserVoice forums. I also create the pop-up questionnaires that you see in the Photos app. </p>

<p>My team works hard to make reliving your digital memories fast and easy, and my role is to help my team understand which features and fixes our users want most. I also make sure our users know when we’ve added a popular request. I’ve investigated issues in the Microsoft Community forums in the past, and it’s always very satisfying when I can tell a user that their problem is fixed in the newest update.</p>

<p>Personally, my favorite Windows 10 feature is the search integration with Cortana. As a keyboard-heavy user, it saves me a lot of time to have Cortana find my apps and files, do quick math for me, or quickly start a web search. As for my favorite app, I have to say the Photos app. My phone is filled with pictures of my two dogs out on adventures, and having my camera roll sorted into albums automatically helps me get straight to enjoying my content instead of fiddling around with folders.</p>
