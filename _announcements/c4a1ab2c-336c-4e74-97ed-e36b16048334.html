<h4><strong>Known issues </strong></h4>

<ul>
  <li>The Visual Studio emulator for Windows 10 Mobile and Hololens will fail with “An authentication error has occurred. The Local Security Authority cannot be contacted”. If you are a developer and require the emulator for building apps, we suggesting moving to the Slow ring and skipping this build until we can fix this issue. </li>

  <li>We continue to investigate issues with Narrator and other screen reader apps that make them unable to read selected text in the Feedback Hub, Cortana, and other apps. </li>

  <li>In Microsoft Edge, some large downloads may appear to get stuck at 99% completion. You can work around this issue by renaming the file in your downloads after closing Microsoft Edge. This workaround skips security checks on the file, so it should be used only with files from a trusted source. </li>

  <li>In some cases, attempting to turn on Developer Mode on may crash the Settings app. If this happens, the workaround is to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development">use these steps here</a> to enable Developer Mode. </li>

  <li>Some apps notifications may only show the icon – however the full text of the notification will be visible within Action Center. </li>

  <li>[ADDED 4/7] We are investigating an issue where UWPs do not appear on the taskbar when minimized. When this happens, the app icons don’t show up on the taskbar and they are also not shown in ALT + Tab or Task View. The only way to maximize these apps is via Task Manager. Additionally, you can try restarting &nbsp;Explorer.exe from Task Manager to get out of this state.</li>
</ul>
