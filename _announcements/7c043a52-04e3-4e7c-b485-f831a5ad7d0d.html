<p><em>UPDATE 4/27: The server-side issues should be resolved. Cortana should be able to search your Office 365 content.</em></p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>Today we are releasing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14332 for both PC and Mobile to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring. Some languages and editions are still being propagated at the time of going live with this flight, but we expect these to be <a name="_GoBack"></a>available within the hour.</p>

<h3><b>The Bug Bash begins!</b></h3>

<p>With this new build today for PC and Mobile – we’re officially kicking off the Bug Bash with Windows Insiders we <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/04/22/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14328-for-pc-and-mobile/">mentioned last week</a>. Over the course of the next 4 days, we will be publishing multiple Quests inside Feedback Hub that will highlight different areas of the product each day. We will be looking for feedback on each Quest, but you can also just use the parts of Windows and our apps you are most passionate about – the key is just to work together now through Sunday to get the best bug reports possible!</p>

<p>The Quests that you will see for the Bug Bash are not traditional Quests that list steps of trying a feature or scenario out. Many of them are open ended intentionally so that you can perform the steps that come naturally to you in order to finish the Quest and give us feedback on it. Many of them also list more than one scenario that can be tried out to finish the Quest. All the Quests for the Bug Bash will lead back to Feedback Hub so that you can upvote existing feedback or give new feedback based on your experience of completing the Quest. Please make sure to search for existing feedback to upvote before entering a new report. </p>

<p>We are also doing a few different types of Quests:</p>

<p><b>LIMITED TIME Quests</b>: Quests marked as “LIMITED TIME” will expire within 24hrs of being published so make sure you get to these before the time runs out and they’re replaced with new Quests.</p>

<p><b>ADVANCED Quests:</b> Quests marked as “ADVANCED” are more technical and may require changing the system configuration on your device and require an understanding on how to revert the changes after the Quest is done. You should only perform Quests that you feel comfortable doing, if something goes wrong you’ll need to be able to troubleshoot how to get back to a good state on your PC. </p>

<p>After you get this new build installed, open up Feedback Hub and get started. We’re REALLY excited about being able to include you for the first time on something that is part of our internal engineering culture at Microsoft. As I’ve been talking to people all week, I keep seeing big smiles and lots of excitement as people talk about how awesome it is to include Insiders as part of our activities. We hope you have fun as well, and send us some great bug reports. For more information on this week’s Bug Bash – <a href="http://aka.ms/wipbugbash">see this post in Feedback Hub from Mike Fortin</a>. </p>

<h3><b>Here’s what’s new in Build 14332</b></h3>

<p><b>Bash and Command Prompt Improvements: </b>In previous builds, you may have experienced networking issues that prevented tools running in Bash on Ubuntu on Windows from being able to access the Internet. For example, you may have seen apt-get fail to find its servers and download apps. This release fixes these issues and users should no longer need to modify their resolv.conf file by hand. We also fixed an issue when calling mv between the /mnt and non-/mnt drives - files and directories will now move correctly between the two points. For more information about the Bash updates in this build, check out our release notes.</p>

<p>For Command Prompt, we’ve made several improvements including improved windows scaling on PCs with High-DPI displays, better font selection and rendering for international characters, several cursor rendering and hiding improvements, improved background color painting, as well as improved scrolling for nano &amp; EMACS editors. </p>

<p><b>Cortana can now search Office 365: </b>On your PC,<b> </b>Cortana can now search your content in Office 365 including your emails, contacts, calendar as well as files in OneDrive for Business and SharePoint. To get started, just add your Office 365 work or school account in the Connected Accounts section of Cortana’s Notebook. When you search, choose the appropriate filter (email, contacts, calendar, or documents) at the top to see relevant Office 365 search results. Try this out and let us know what you think!</p>

<p><i>UPDATE: Due to server-side issues happening at the moment, this capability may not work. We’re working to get these server-side issues resolved shortly. We’ll update this post once that happens!</i></p>

<p><b>Improved Battery Life for Connected Standby PC’s</b>: We’ve integrated the same underlying technology that Battery Saver uses to quiet down some of the less-valuable activity that occurs during Connected Standby while still keeping your PC connected to the Internet and allowing key connectivity scenarios to work. As a result, if you’re using a Surface or other Connected Standby PC, many of you will notice improved and more consistent standby battery life.</p>

<p><i>Tip: To see if you are running a PC with Connected Standby, you can run the “powercfg /a” command from an admin Command Prompt. If the first state listed says “Standby (S0 Low Power Idle) Network Connected”, you’re running on a PC capable of Connected Standby.</i></p>

<p>While we have worked hard to get the technology behind this to work optimally for what we think will be the vast majority of users, we’d like your feedback. If you notice any major issues (things you expected to work in Connected Standby but that do not), you have 2 options:</p>

<p>1. Go into Settings &gt; System &gt; Battery and enable the app that you want to run during Connected Standby to “Always allowed” in the background. You can read more about these battery settings in <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/04/22/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14328-for-pc-and-mobile/">last week’s blog post</a>.</p>

<p>2. If you want to revert fully back to the old behavior in Connected Standby, you can run the following command lines from an admin Command Prompt:</p>

<p>powercfg /setdcvalueindex SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_ENERGYSAVER ESPOLICY 0</p>

<p>powercfg /setactive scheme_current</p>

<p>Note: To re-enable the new Connected Standby behavior, you can run the same command lines as above but just change ‘0’ to ‘1’.</p>

<p>If you find that a scenario you depend on doesn’t work in the way you expect it to, please send us feedback via the Feedback Hub!</p>
