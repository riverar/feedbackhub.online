<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>As you know in the Windows Insider Program we love to hear your feedback to know how we can make our products better (see Samer Sawaya’s <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/06/12/how-windows-insider-feedback-influences-windows-10-development/">post</a> here for how use feedback to make a better Windows). We are also always looking for ways to improve the Windows Insider Program. We get lots of great feedback from lots of you at various events, via Twitter, and in the Windows Feedback App that we use to help shape the direction of the Windows Insider Program. </p>

<p>We have lots of exciting plans for the Windows Insider Program in 2016 that we will share as we complete the work in future builds. From time to time a larger form survey helps us take all the feedback we have received and better prioritize this feedback against our plans with the opinions of all Windows Insiders around the world. We will also use this survey and future surveys, in this long form or in the product, to gauge how well we are doing with the Windows Insider Program. </p>

<p>If there is something you have been meaning to tell us or ask for now is your time. It’s through feedback, including this survey, that allows us to use the voice of the Windows Insiders to make a better Windows and makes the Windows and Device Group a better team.</p>

<p>This week, we’re going to send our first global survey to Windows Insiders in 20 languages hosted by our survey vendor SurveryGizmo.com to better understand Insiders across the globe and to use that feedback to grow and improve the Insider Program.</p>

<p><b>We’d deeply appreciate if you can take 10-15 minutes to let us know what you think by filling the survey out – you can access the survey via the links below.</b></p>

<p>For taking the time to complete this survey and if you choose to include your associated Microsoft Insider email address, <b>you’ll be entered into a sweepstakes to</b> <b>win a free Surface Book!*</b></p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>g</p>
