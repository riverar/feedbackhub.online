<p>To give you even more insight into Windows 10, we’d like to introduce you to some of the people on our team and how they support the platform – and Windows Insiders like you. We’ll feature team profiles on an ongoing basis here in the Hub. </p>

<p><b>Jeff Ermak – Software Engineer II</b></p>

<p><b>What technologies do you work on? </b></p>

<p>I work on the Windows peripherals team for printers and scanners.&nbsp; We look at feedback to discover bugs, usability issues, and find suggestions for new Windows features. For Windows 10 I spent most of my time working on printing support for phones.&nbsp; I wrote the internal app for our team to try out printing from phones and helped the photos app team get printing working on phone.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite feature in Windows 10?</strong></p>

<p>I like asking Cortana to remind me to do something in 15 minutes.&nbsp; It saves a lot of sticky notes.</p>

<p><b>Describe one of your favorite experiences with the Insider community</b></p>

<p>One of the best experiences with the Insider community dealt with some feedback on some of the UI changes we made for 10.&nbsp; A user didn’t notice one of the buttons that we had added, so we made changes to make it more discoverable.&nbsp; It is great to get feedback from insiders while we are still developing the product and there is time to fix it.</p>

<p><b>What do you do outside of work?</b></p>

<p>Outside of work I spend time with my wife, 3 month old daughter, and dog.&nbsp; I play hockey, soccer, mountain bike, and snowboard when I have free time.&nbsp; </p>
