<p>When we <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2014/09/30/announcing-windows-10/">first unveiled Windows 10 in September</a>, we outlined our plans for a new era of Windows. We wanted to create a Windows that empowered people and organizations to do great things. Our vision was one platform, one store, and one experience that extends across the broadest range of devices from the smallest screens to the largest screens to no screens at all.</p>

<p>For Microsoft, <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/01/21/the-next-generation-of-windows-windows-10/">Windows 10 begins to deliver on our vision for more personal computing</a>. In this world experiences are mobile, moving with you seamlessly and easily across your devices. Interacting with technology is as natural as interacting with people – using voice, pen, gestures and even gaze for the right interaction, in the right way, at the right time. And in our connected and transparent world, we respect your privacy and help protect your information.</p>

<p>From the beginning, Windows 10 has been unique – built with feedback from five million Windows Insiders, delivered as a service with ongoing innovations and security updates, and offered as a free upgrade* to genuine Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 customers.</p>

<p>Over the months we’ve demonstrated how Windows 10 delivers new capabilities to PCs, tablets, phones, and Raspberry Pi, with innovations like Microsoft Edge, Cortana, Continuum and Windows Hello, and how entirely new categories of devices like Hololens and Surface Hub, will be enabled with Windows 10.</p>

<p>We are delighted to make Windows 10 available in 190 countries today. The <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/07/13/windows-10-launch-celebrating-with-our-fans-and-announcing-upgradeyourworld/">launch of Windows 10</a> is being celebrated around the world with global fan celebrations and a new yearlong initiative to celebrate people and organizations making a difference around the world. We’d love to hear how you plan to help <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/upgradeyourworld/">#UpgradeYourWorld</a>.&nbsp;Starting today, you can vote for a global nonprofit to receive a cash donation by simply tagging their social handle and using #UpgradeYourWorld and #vote on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter. More information on Upgrade Your World can be found at <a href="http://www.windows.com/upgradeyourworld">http://www.windows.com/upgradeyourworld</a>.</p>

<p>Together with our partners, we’re ready for a new era of Windows – we hope you’ll join us.</p>

<h4><strong>Windows 10: The Best Windows Ever</strong></h4>

<p>As we begin to roll out Windows 10 to the world, we want to empower our customers to do great things. We will deliver this in four key ways:</p>
