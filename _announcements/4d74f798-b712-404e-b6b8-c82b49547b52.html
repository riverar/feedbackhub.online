<ul>
  <li>After choosing “Reset This PC” under Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery – your PC will be in a unusable state. There is no workaround if your PC gets into this state and you will need to reinstall Windows. </li>

  <li>You might see a WSClient.dll error dialog after logging in. We’re working on a fix for this but as a workaround, you can run the following in Command Prompt with administrative rights: schtasks /delete /TN “\Microsoft\Windows\WS\WSRefreshBannedAppsListTask” /F </li>

  <li>The Connect button does not show up in Action Center. The workaround is to press Windows key + P and then click “Connect to a wireless display”. </li>

  <li>Due to a recent memory management change, you may see periodic app crashes or other memory related app errors.&nbsp;Rebooting your PC may correct the issue.&nbsp;Due to this issue, the Github client will not launch. If you need to use the Github client – the workaround is to rollback to the previous build. </li>

  <li>F12 Developer Tools will not load in Microsoft Edge. Should be fixed in the next build.</li>
</ul>
