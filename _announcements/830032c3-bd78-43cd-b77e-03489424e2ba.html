<h3><strong>Other improvements and fixes for Mobile</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>We fixed a scaling issue on devices such as the Lumia 635, 636, or 638 where the bottom of certain apps, like Messaging and Maps, would get cut off and rendered off screen. </li>

  <li>We heard you and we have addressed the largest cause of reliability issues in Microsoft Edge running on Insider Preview builds. This should improve reliability on major websites such as Facebook and Outlook.com. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue resulting in the sound of key presses and lock/unlock being barely audible when the phone was using a moderate volume. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where, if Quiet Hours had been turned on, banner notifications might not start appearing again until Action Center was opened or an interactive notification popped up and was dismissed. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where Cortana would crash when trying to open Reminders page. </li>

  <li>We have improved the reliability of VPN Settings page via Settings &gt; Network &amp; wireless &gt; VPN. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue resulting in the thumbnail for portrait videos displaying with an incorrect aspect ratio in the Photos app when panning through the Camera Roll.</li>
