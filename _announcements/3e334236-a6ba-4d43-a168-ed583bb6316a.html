<ul>
  <li>We are tracking an issue reported by Insiders where some PCs will freeze or bluescreen when resuming from hibernation. Disabling hibernation is a workaround in some cases until this is fixed. </li>

  <li>If you have Kaspersky Anti-Virus, Internet Security, or the Kaspersky Total Security Suite installed on your PC there is a known driver bug that prevents these programs from working as expected in builds from the Development Branch. We are partnering with Kaspersky to fix this issue for a future release, but at this time there are no known workarounds. While this issue is present, we recommend using Windows Defender or another third party anti-virus product of your choice to remain protected. </li>

  <li>Turning on the “always show all icons in the notification area” setting disrupts the layout of the notification area (“systray”). </li>

  <li>When browsing in Microsoft Edge, charts displayed using D3.js library will not display correctly – e.g. render as black, positioned incorrectly. Known affected sites are Cortana, Bing.com, and PowerBI.com.</li>
