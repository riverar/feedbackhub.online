<p>Hello Windows Insiders!</p>

<p>Today we are excited to be releasing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14959 for Mobile and PC to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring.</p>

<h3><strong>The Windows 10 Creators Update</strong></h3>

<p>Last week, we held an event in New York to share our aspiration to empower a new wave of creativity with the Windows 10 Creators Update and new devices such as the Surface Studio and Surface Dial. You can catch up on all the details on the things we announced at the event by <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/10/26/empowering-a-new-wave-of-creativity-with-the-windows-10-creators-update-and-surface-studio/">checking out this blog post from Terry Myerson</a>. As I mentioned last week, Windows is an iceberg, the features that people “see” are quite a small percent of the engineering work that we do to enable new UI to be visible. Windows Insiders running the latest builds have already been trying out the Creators Update – including last week’s build (<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/10/25/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14955-for-mobile-and-pc/">Build 14955</a>). The new and exciting visible features you saw shown off at the event will start rolling out in builds in the coming weeks. Features such as the <a href="https://www.remix3d.com/">Paint 3D Preview</a>&nbsp;are now available for Insiders to try right now!&nbsp;We’re excited to get more of the new Creators Update features in the hands of Insiders in the next couple of months.</p>

<h3><strong>What’s new in Build 14959</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Unified Update Platform:</strong> This build for Mobile is being published using our new update publishing system called Unified Update Platform (UUP). For more information on UUP – <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/11/03/introducing-unified-update-platform-uup">check out this blog post from Bill</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Controlling the Display Scaling of your Virtual Machines (PC)</strong>: &nbsp;We’ve heard your feedback that Hyper-V Virtual Machines sometimes aren’t scaled as you’d expect, so we’ve added a new Zoom option in the View menu, where you can override the default scaling and set it to 100, 125, 150 or 200 – whichever matches your preference. Along the way, we also fixed an issue where certain VMs wouldn’t display the remote desktop connection bar after entering full screen mode. We are still refining the experience so there might be some rough edges. For example, although we added zoom levels to handle high DPI more gracefully, when zooming you won’t be able to see the VM’s whole screen without scrolling.</p>

<h3><strong>Other improvements and fixes for PC</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>We fixed an issue for Insiders resulting in the automatic brightness setting unexpectedly being turned off after upgrading. In doing so, we’ve re-enabled automatic brightness adjust for users that have never changed their auto-brightness setting. If you have already manually configured your auto-brightness setting, then this fix will not affect you. If you would like to enable or disable automatic brightness adjustment, please go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Display, where you can adjust your preferences. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue Insiders on domain connected PCs may have experienced where login might fail when the computer was disconnected from its domain network. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue resulting in certain apps, such as Outlook Mail and Calendar, failing to update for some Insiders with the error code 0x800700B7. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue for Insiders with certain device models where ejecting an SD card might result in a system crash. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where disliking one of the Spotlight lock screen images would show the new image immediately, followed by a transition animation from the previous image to the new image. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where launching an app from another app while in Tablet mode no longer launched it side by side, and instead launched it fullscreen (for example, when launching a web link from the MSN News app). </li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Other improvements and fixes for Mobile</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>The data usage page in Settings via Settings &gt; Network &amp; wireless &gt; Data usage has been updated with performance and UI improvements. </li>

  <li>We fixed issues preventing Insiders from adding cards to Wallet and paying using tap to pay. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue resulting in being unexpectedly able to close Start in the task switcher. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue resulting in certain options for default calling app via Settings &gt; System &gt; Phone &gt; Default apps from being unexpectedly missing. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue causing apps that play media in the background, such as Groove Music, to stop when Battery Saver turns on. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue Insiders may have experienced where the phone would get into a state where copy/paste wouldn’t work until the device had been restarted. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where Settings might hang after unchecking “Let apps automatically use this VPN connection” in VPN Settings. </li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>November 2016 Bug Bash begins next week! </strong></h3>

<p>We are moving the Bug Bash start date up to Monday, November&nbsp;7th 12:01 AM PST. We wanted to give you, Windows Insiders, and our Windows Engineers the same dates for finding bugs (in the past our engineers started a day early)! We will start the Bug Bash on Build 14959 that is being released today so you can have time to get your PC’s and phones updated prior to the Bug Bash so you can start Quests as soon as they are published.&nbsp; The Bug Bash will still finish at the end of the day on Sunday, November 13th (PST). Our whole team will be bug bashing with some fun events in-house and we are looking forward to seeing a lot of participation from Insiders!</p>

<p>If you have ideas on what Quests you will like to see for the Bug Bash, <a href="https://aka.ms/qsu6xg">let us know</a>!</p>

<h3><strong>Team Updates</strong></h3>

<p>We just returned from our Ignite NZ adventure! It was amazing to meet so many Windows Insiders and receive so much love from the amazing community down in New Zealand. Many of you have been asking for us to share our content so here you go: my keynote on <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AsZhwyqz-k09kosXWzTwzhInu0Rbbg">tech innovation</a>,&nbsp; Jeremiah Marble’s and my <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Ignite/New-Zealand-2016/M236">Co-Create Community</a>, Katharane Holdsworth’s <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Ignite/New-Zealand-2016/M206">Inside Windows Insider Program</a> and an interview with Kyle Drunkerley, one of our Insiders in an <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/New-Zealand-2016/C9L09">Insider Interview</a>.</p>
