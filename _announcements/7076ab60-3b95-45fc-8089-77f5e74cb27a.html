<p><strong><font color="#000000">Windows 10 Team Profile</font></strong></p>

<p><font color="#000000">To give you even more insight into Windows 10, we’d like to introduce you to some of the people on our team and how they support the platform – and Windows Insiders like you. We’ll feature team profiles on an ongoing basis here in the Hub.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Saul R. Gomez – Software Engineer </strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><img src="http://compass.microsoft.com/assets/5c/79/5c79890d-5f0d-4d1a-8fc9-b1a1991450e4.png?n=Saul%20Ricardo%20Gomez.png" width="301" height="293" /></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">I’m a </font><a></a><a><font color="#000000">Quality </font></a><font color="#000000">Engineer on the Shell team, and my team owns Identity which is a huge part of Windows. We work on features like Windows Hello, the Accounts Experience, and the Logon Experience, just to mention some of them. Also, I’m a Community Champion for my team, so I visit forums, 3<sup>rd</sup> party sites and Twitter to understand how customers are liking our features and to answer questions when I can. </font></p>

<p><b><font color="#000000">What technologies do you work on?</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000">I work on the Accounts Experience. This is where you can add, manage and delete your email accounts. This is a vital part of the OS, so I make sure everything is working smoothly so our customers can start using the built-in Mail, Calendar and People apps. </font></p>

<p><b><font color="#000000">What’s your favorite feature on Windows 10?</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000">I can’t think of just one feature that I like; Cortana is amazing. I can reach her almost everywhere now: on my desktop, on my phone and soon on Xbox. The same rule applies to Groove, where I can listen to my music and playlists, everywhere I am, you name it. </font></p>

<p><b><font color="#000000">What’s your favorite app?</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000">I have two favorite apps, Xbox and Groove. I love music and games.</font></p>

<p><b><font color="#000000">Describe one of your favorite experiences with the Insider community</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The Insider Community is always willing to help and I love that. We are here for them, every time you ask for more details about a problem they answer almost immediately.</font></p>

<p><b><font color="#000000">What do you do outside of work?</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000">I spend most of my time playing video games or working out. </font></p>
