<h3><b>Known issues for Mobile</b></h3>

<ul>
  <li><b><u>Please avoid</u></b><b> attempting to install new languages, keyboards, and speech packs on your phone.</b> There is a chance these downloads may get stuck and not finish downloading. If you have existing languages, keyboards, and speech packs installed â€“ they will carry over when you update to new builds. You can use <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12379/windows-10-mobile-device-recovery-tool-faq">Windows Device Recovery Tool</a> to go back to Windows Phone 8.1 or Windows 10 Mobile, install any languages, keyboards, and speech packs you need and then update to the latest build in the Fast ring as a workaround.</li>

  <li>Windows 10 phones with 8GB of internal storage such as the Lumia 550 and 650 will likely receive an 0x800700b7 error when attempting to update to this build.</li>

  <li>System related notification toasts (e.g. Bluetooth, USB/Autoplay, etc.) do not work. </li>
</ul>
