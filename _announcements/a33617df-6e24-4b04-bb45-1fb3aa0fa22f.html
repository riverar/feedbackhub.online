<p>To give you even more insight into Windows 10, we’d like to introduce you to some of the people on our team and how they support the platform – and Windows Insiders like you. We’ll feature team profiles on an ongoing basis here in the Hub. </p>

<p><b>Kristin Flatness/Software Engineer II</b></p>

<p><b>What technologies do you work on?</b></p>

<p>I work on the Hardware Experiences Quality team.&nbsp; I support parts of the Silicon Platform team (which covers hardware such as Bluetooth, Sensors and Busses) with their Community engagement, spending time in the forums answering questions and bringing issues from there to the team. &nbsp;I also track our Platform Health, making sure that the bugs are moving through the workflow appropriately and aren’t overlooked.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite feature in Windows 10?</strong></p>

<p>My favorite feature in Windows 10 is the start menu.&nbsp; I had to go back to 8.1 for a bit on my main laptop and that is the one feature that I really missed.&nbsp; I had a hard time finding what I needed without the new start menu.</p>

<p><b>Describe one of your favorite experiences with the Insider community</b></p>

<p>My favorite experience is anytime my response gets marked as Answered.&nbsp; That means the info I provided really helped someone work through their problem and then can be used to help others.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>What do you do outside of work?</b></p>

<p>Outside of work, I play soccer a couple of times a week.&nbsp; It is a great way to get some exercise, relieve stress and have fun with a bunch of friends.&nbsp; And if I am not playing soccer, I love to spend time with my 9 year old nephews and working in my yard.</p>
