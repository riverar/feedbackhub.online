<p>Hello Windows Insiders! </p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/08/02/how-to-get-the-windows-10-anniversary-update/">we began rolling out the Windows 10 Anniversary Update for Windows 10 Mobile</a>. Thank you to all of the Windows Insiders who downloaded the Cumulative Updates first and gave us feedback that helped us prepare for this release to our customers. Today we are excited to be releasing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14905 for PC AND Mobile to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring! This is our first new Mobile build from our Development Branch after launching the Windows 10 Anniversary Update yesterday for Windows 10 phones. We know you all have been excited for Mobile builds to start up again as have we! </p>

<h3>Here’s what’s new in Build 14371 for Mobile</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We are introducing a newly refined sound set in this build, uniting the best of our past and present. We aspire to set a new bar for mobile sound set quality, and are trying to make the soundscape of technology more beautiful and harmonious. This also helps align with new sound design direction of the Windows platform as a whole, so that mobile sounds will family with desktop and tablet and be feel instantly familiar to all Windows users. We will continue to evolve – head to Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Sounds to see the updated list of available sounds and let us know what you think!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements and fixes for PC</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We have fixed an issue causing a large blank space to appear between the address bar and web content after the address bar moves back to the top when opening a new tab in Microsoft Edge. </li>

  <li>We have updated Narrator Scan mode for table navigation to now support CTRL + ALT + HOME to go to the beginning of the table CTRL + ALT + END to go to the end of the table. </li>

  <li>Microsoft Edge now supports the CTRL + O keyboard shortcut for setting focus to the address bar. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue resulting in Sketchpad and Screen Sketch crashing after trying to change the ink color twice in a row when the ruler was visible. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements and fixes for Mobile</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Missed call notifications are now more actionable, with inline options to call back, text or remind yourself to do something about it later. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where videos played in Windows Phone 8 apps might not pause when an incoming call was received. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where, if “Show my caller ID” is set to “My contacts”, the contact being called might still see a blocked caller ID. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue where the Lock screen might fail to update to the new time after a time zone change. </li>

  <li>We fixed an issue resulting in music not resuming after a call was finished, if Turn-by-Turn directions were being read out from the Maps app when the phone call came in. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Known issues for PC</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Support for kernel debugging over 1394 has been removed, but will be available in an upcoming kit release. A work-around will be posted to the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/windbg/">Debugging Tools for Windows Blog</a> shortly. </li>

  <li>Adobe Acrobat Reader crashes when you try to launch it. </li>

  <li>Cortana’s text to speech capabilities is not working in this build. For example, Cortana won’t be able to read text messages out loud for you, tell jokes, sing, or give verbal prompts. </li>

  <li>When clicking on the power button on the Start menu, it closes the Start menu without opening the flyout with restart/shutdown options appearing. As a workaround – you can right-click on the Start button (or WIN + X) and choose to shutdown via this menu instead. </li>

  <li>Apps such as Yahoo Mail, Trivia Crack, Google and the Skype Translator Preview app will crash in this build due to a compatibility issue from a recent platform change. </li>

  <li>The Settings app may crash on certain editions of Windows 10 when navigating to different settings pages due to a missing .dll file. We are working on getting this fixed soon. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Known issues for Mobile</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If you move apps between a SD card and internal storage (either direction), those apps will get stuck in a pending state. The workaround to get your apps working again is to uninstall the app through Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage (apps cannot be uninstalled from All apps list). Then you can re-install the app from the Store. </li>

  <li>Cortana’s text to speech capabilities is not working in this build. For example, Cortana won’t be able to read text messages out loud for you, tell jokes, sing, or give verbal prompts. </li>
</ul>

<p>A few months ago, we set out to design a new T-shirt for the Windows Insiders Program - and what better source for ideas than Windows Insiders themselves! So, we organized a design competition with a few simple rules: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Come up with a design that reflected the innovative spirit of the Windows Insider Program </li>

  <li>Include the Windows logo and a call out to Windows Insiders. </li>
</ol>

<p>In just a few weeks, we received some absolutely amazing designs from around the world. After a long - and often heated - selection process (including a vote by the Windows Insider community), our judges narrowed it down to five finalists before picking the ultimate winner: a beautiful design concept by E. Bautista from the United States. The final design below (zoom in to see the finer details) will soon be available on the <a href="https://microsoftmerchandise.com/Shop#/">eCompanyStore</a>. We’ll let you know when it’s ready. Thanks to everyone for participating and congratulations to our finalists - and ultimate winner! </p>

<p>Thank you for everything you do and your amazing passion for Windows. We love you. </p>

<p>Keep hustling, 
  <br />Dona &lt;3</p>
