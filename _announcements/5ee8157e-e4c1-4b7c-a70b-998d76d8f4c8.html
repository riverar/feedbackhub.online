<ul>
  <li>We’re investigating an issue in which some Surface Pro 3, Surface Pro 4, and Surface Book devices experience a freeze or hang and all input such as keyboard/trackpad and touch do not work. The workaround is to hold down the power button to force the device to hard-reboot. </li>

  <li>We are continuing to track several issues reported by Insiders where some PCs will freeze or bluescreen when resuming from hibernation. Disabling hibernation is a workaround in some cases until this is fixed. </li>

  <li>If you have Kaspersky Anti-Virus, Internet Security, or the Kaspersky Total Security Suite installed on your PC there is a known driver bug that prevents these programs from working as expected in builds from the Development Branch. We are partnering with Kaspersky to fix this issue for a future release, but at this time there are no known workarounds. While this issue is present, we recommend using Windows Defender or another third party anti-virus product of your choice to remain protected. </li>

  <li>Turning on the “always show all icons in the notification area” setting disrupts the layout of the notification area (“systray”). Your notification area will look out of alignment. </li>

  <li>We are seeing reports of crashes with apps such as QQ crashing due to an OS reliability issue we are currently investigating. This bug is also impacting older apps such as Windows Live Mail and Expression Encoder 4. </li>

  <li>Connectivity to older Wi-Fi networks using the WEP encryption security method may be broken.&nbsp; WEP is an insecure method for protecting your Wi-Fi connection but a small percentage of Windows users still use it.&nbsp; A workaround would be to configure your wireless routers to use WPA or WPA2 or wait for the next Insider flight when this is fixed.</li>
