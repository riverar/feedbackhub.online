<p>Many of you have been asking about getting a new build this week. Unfortunately, we don’t have a good candidate to release to you right now. We have hit an issue with N + 1 updates (the update path going forward from one build to another). We have a commitment to never leave our community in a bad state if we can help it. We certainly don’t want to release a build that would leave Insiders stuck and requiring a reinstall of Windows to get back into a good state. We believe we have solved the issue and are pushing new builds out through our internal rings right now to test the solution. If everything looks good, we hope to have a new build for you next week. </p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Dona </p>
